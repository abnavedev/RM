Preface
This book should have been published in 2016 when the country completed twenty-five years of economic reforms. That was our intention, but it was clearly too ambitious to expect success in producing such a book within eight months of the inception of the idea. But, better late than never.
  I have been fortunate to have had the opportunity to serve the Government of India in a host of different capacities throughout the reform period from 1991 until late 2015. For a professional economist, nothing can be more exciting and gratifying than being part of a policy process that sets a country on a sustainable growth path that lasts over a long period. India has already grown at an average annual rate of around 6.5 per cent for almost thirty-five years. This was a significant acceleration over the anaemic rate of 3–3.5 per cent over the previous thirty-five years. We can hope that such a process will continue and even accelerate to the next stage at near 10 per cent over the next quarter century and beyond. As documented by the World Bank’s growth commission, since 1950, only thirteen countries have exhibited annual growth rates of 7 per cent or more for a period of twenty-five years or longer. India hasn’t quite joined this exclusive group but it must be our collective endeavour to do so in the coming years. That is the challenge facing the next generation of economic strategy, reform processes and performance.
  This is therefore a good time to chronicle the kind of change that the country has experienced over this past quarter century. In some areas the change has been truly transformative, while in others, much more could have been done, particularly in the areas of health, education and agriculture. What reforms were carried out and how do they affect the country? What were our expectations in 1991? What has been achieved, and what not? And, where do we go from here? These are the kind of questions that we set out to address as we started work on this book.
  Through my thirty years being in and around the government, I have had the good fortune of being associated in different ways with each of the remarkable individuals who have contributed to this book. I have called upon our bonds of friendship to persuade each of these busy individuals to reflect on their experience as they have transformed themselves, their respective organizations and their country over these twenty-five years. This book brings together thirty technocratic leaders who have participated in this exciting project of nation-building since the early 1990s. This group includes some of the key policymakers and advisers, academics, industry leaders, opinion makers and commentators. Each of them has made key contributions over this period to bring India where it is today. They have worked in their respective fields consistently, and retained their credibility and commitment across a succession of diverse governments of different political persuasions. They have displayed professionalism of the highest order in their respective areas of operations.
  My greatest debt of gratitude goes to each of these impressive individuals who, in their folly, agreed to engage and commit their time to contributing to this collection. Given the many different pursuits that they are engaged in, it has been an act of considerable generosity to submit to the tortuous process that goes into the publication of any book. Each of them submitted to the various revisions that I subjected them to, somewhat cheerfully, and then to the professional editing process that followed.
  Hence, my heartfelt appreciation for this act of friendship expressed by each of the contributors.
  Vikram Mehta, in his role as chairman of Brookings India, must shoulder the blame for setting me on this task. As I returned to India in late 2015, after serving as executive director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), he asked me to babysit Brookings India in early 2016 as he hunted for a full-time successor to Subir Gokarn who had led Brookings India from its inception in 2013, and who had to leave to succeed me at the IMF. As I took up my position in Brookings India, he thought I should also do something more substantive. He came up with the idea that Brookings India should do something to commemorate twenty-five years of reforms. Foolishly, I agreed readily. Then ensued a number of discussions of what this task would entail; and the idea of this collection emerged. My sincere thanks to Vikram for setting me up for doing this and then providing unstinting support, both personally and institutionally. This included active prodding of some recalcitrant authors.
  I have received consistent support from Nitika Mehta, the head of development and communications, and Shruti Gakhar, the development and communications officer at Brookings India, throughout the fifteen months or so that this project has taken. Nitika was instrumental in convincing Penguin Random House to publish this volume; how she did so remains a mystery to me since it agreed to do so even before there was any content available. Shruti has been diligently keeping track of each draft article at every stage and has kept all communications with both authors and the editors in good order. Together, they have been the chief interlocutors with the publishers and authors. Along with the publishers, they are also responsible for managing the communications strategy for promotion of the book. My sincere thanks for their consistent and devoted diligence to these tasks which have been far beyond their normal calls of duty at Brookings.
  My academic home is now at the Jackson Institute for Global Affairs at Yale University. Most of the work on this volume was done over the 2016–17 academic year at Yale. My sincere thanks go to Jim Levinsohn, the director of the Jackson Institute, for inviting me back to teach at Yale. The quiet, salubrious and supportive environment at the institute was very helpful in getting this task done. As it happens, the finishing touches to my last book were also done at the Jackson Institute in Yale in 2010.
  The team at Penguin Random House, led by Meru Gokhale, has been remarkable in the kind of support they have provided which has involved interaction with thirty-two authors. They have been consistently patient and cooperative. Anushree Kaushal has led the editorial team, supported by Rachita Raj and Shanuj V.C.; and Preeti Chaturvedi has led the promotion efforts for the book. My gratitude to all at Penguin who have made this book possible.
  I also owe a debt of gratitude to the time and effort that Ritu Vajpeyi-Mohan has devoted to educating me in the art of bookmaking and promotion.
  After he took over at Brookings India as executive director, Harsha Vardhana Singh has provided continual encouragement for this enterprise, apart from making his own path-breaking contribution on trade. My sincere thanks.
  Finally, I must thank Strobe Talbott for his support as president of Brookings in Washington, and specifically for agreeing to contribute his perspective—from a distance—on India’s transformation.
  My family has been almost oblivious to the work that I have been doing on this book! But my intensive engagement in policymaking over the past quarter century and frequent intercontinental movement between India and the United States over the past five years, would not have been possible without their collective forbearance, active support, tolerance and inspiration. My wife, Rasika, has been a tower of strength, especially in the last few years of extreme trial and tribulation, providing me with great cheerfulness, the environment of peace and tranquillity that is essential for undertaking such an endeavour. Tarini, my daughter, inspires us all with her continuing battle against adversity; and Rasesh, my son, gives us consistent support without compromising his own professional goals. His equanimity in the face of many competing professional and personal demands is a lesson on how to keep focus on the essentials.
  I dedicate this book to my family: Rasika, Tarini and Rasesh.
 
 
Foreword
Strobe Talbott
This timely, authoritative and policy-relevant volume sheds light on India’s dramatic changes over the past quarter century. That transformation has not only been a boon to the people of India, it has also contributed to the progress of the human enterprise as a whole. The world’s largest democracy is a major player on the world stage. It is certainly viewed and valued that way by my own country, the United States of America.
  The economic and commercial dimension of India’s evolution is, of course, crucial. Hence, the focus of submissions in the pages that follow is political economy, financial development, trade and globalization, technology and innovation, agricultural and industrial development, and the interaction between the private and public sectors. The contributors include some of the original designers and implementers of the reform process, along with the prominent business leaders who have been the most successful builders of the economy.
  There is also, thanks to the inclusion of wisdom from Shivshankar Menon, Shyam Saran and Sanjaya Baru, due attention paid to India’s foreign and security policy.
  Over the course of the last half-century, I have had numerous opportunities to watch India’s evolution, first from the vantage point of a student of international relations and then for two decades as a journalist. During my eight years in government during the 1990s, I also had a chance to participate in the effort by the Indian and the US governments to put the bilateral relationship on a sounder—indeed, a transformed—footing than had been the case in the first four decades after Indian Independence. Dennis Kux captured the perception on both sides of that star-crossed backstory in the subtitle of his 1992 book, India and the United States: Estranged Democracies.1
  What stymied a robust bond between these two countries? After all, both had wrested their independence from British rule while adopting and adapting many of the features of British constitutional governance (minus, of course, the monarchy).
  The key factor, I’ve always believed, was the Cold War.
  It was approximately at the midpoint of that global schism that I first visited India forty-two years ago. I owe that enriching and informative experience to a glitch in my career as a Sovietologist.
  In those days, I was a reporter for Time magazine concentrating on East–West relations and was assigned to the State Department beat. This often meant whirling around the world, coping with what seemed like a permanent case of jetlag, trying to keep up with the then secretary of state Henry Kissinger.
  In October 1974, Kissinger embarked on a seven-nation diplomatic tour starting with Moscow. The Kremlin was eager to welcome the secretary of state as the personification of continuity in the US policy of détente, in the wake of Richard Nixon’s resignation and Gerald Ford’s ascension to the presidency. The Soviets, however, were not about to extend their hospitality to me. I was persona non grata because of my role in translating and editing Nikita Khrushchev’s memoirs. The material for the two volumes was surreptitiously recorded and spirited out of the country while he was under virtual house arrest, since his ouster from the leadership ten years before. The second volume, published earlier in 1974, particularly irked Foreign Minister Anatoly Gromyko, who sent a message to Kissinger’s plane over the Atlantic, denying me a visa.2
  After I was unceremoniously dropped off in Copenhagen during a fuelling stop, I hopscotched to New Delhi, which would be Kissinger’s second stop after Moscow.
  On the personal front, my several days of free time were immensely gratifying. I made friendships that lasted for decades. I also came to know Ambassador Daniel Patrick Moynihan (whose desk officer at the State Department was none other than Dennis Kux). Moynihan’s wife, Elizabeth, took me under her wing and drove me out to—where else?—the Taj Mahal, where she was already deeply into studying the Mughal gardens.
  In the course of numerous interviews and briefings I had in New Delhi while Kissinger was still in Moscow, I was struck by the deep-rooted and long-simmering tensions in the official relations between the US and Indian governments. These went back to the 1950s, when India’s role as a founder of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) put it at odds with America’s self-assigned leadership of the Free World (a phrase also capitalized in those days). In the aftermath of independence from the Raj, Indian leaders were wary of another Western power claiming a sphere of influence on which the sun would never set. From the official American perspective, India’s purchase of MiGs for its air force and adoption of Soviet-inspired Five-Year Plans led policymakers such as Secretary of State John Foster Dulles to question whose side this giant Asian country was really on.
  Even before Henry Kissinger made his first official visit to India, he had already attracted the eye of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. She was still bristling over the Nixon administration’s refusal, three years before, to support India’s intervention in the Bangladesh Liberation War. The columnist Jack Anderson publicized leaked government documents that exposed Kissinger’s critical sentiments about India and, in particular, Mrs Gandhi.3
  On the US side, there was concern and disapproval of India’s ‘Smiling Buddha’ underground test of a nuclear device earlier in May 1974 (just a little over three months before the Kissinger mission). American protestations exacerbated Indian resentments.
  While Kissinger’s plane was en route from Moscow to New Delhi, Mrs Gandhi gave a press conference denigrating the importance of the impending visit and thereby the visitor himself. To accentuate the snub, she announced that she would be giving the American secretary of state only forty-five minutes of her time before leaving on vacation.
  As though that wasn’t bad enough, Kissinger had to spend three days in India. He put on a brave and polite face in public, but he was furious, not least because he had to a give a speech to a New Delhi foreign-policy organization on non-alignment, a subject he hated in general but particularly in the case of India, given its cordial relations with the Soviet Union.
  Once, to his undisguised relief, Kissinger was back aboard his Air Force Boeing 707 and was leaving New Delhi behind, he came from his luxurious suite behind the cockpit to the back of the plane. That’s where the press corps (including me, now reinstated) was crammed into economy-class seats, pens poised and notebooks ready for a background readout on the diplomatic downer from ‘a senior American official on Secretary Kissinger’s plane’.
  Kissinger had clearly not gotten over his annoyance at Mrs Gandhi. Yet, he also allowed that she was a formidable politician and, like himself, a hard-headed realist.
  Leaving personalities aside, he mused about what underlay ‘the chronic disharmony’ between Washington and New Delhi. He saw it as a regional manifestation of a global division between two ideological and geopolitical camps: India’s uneasy, often conflicted, relationship with Pakistan was vexing and dangerous in its own right, but all the more so given the not-inaccurate perception in New Delhi that the US ‘tilted’ towards Pakistan, and the equally defensible sense in Washington that India leaned toward Moscow—to wit, India’s Soviet-designed military aircraft, not to mention its reliance on five-year economic plans of the sort favoured by Fabian socialists.
  Kissinger was turning his attention to Pakistan because it would be one of the next stops on the trip. In contrast to Mrs Gandhi, he knew that Zulfikar Ali Bhutto would treat him royally. There would be no talk of non-alignment there.
  The secretary concluded his airborne seminar with the reporters by remarking that a genuine partnership between the US and India would be impossible as long as the Cold War lasted. All of us, including him, expected that to be for a very long time, most probably well past our own lifetimes and maybe our children’s. Little did we know that the USSR would last just long enough to reach the biblical lifespan of a single mortal: three score and ten years. The prologue of its demise—though we didn’t realize it as such—came in the form of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979. The administration of Jimmy Carter saw a chance to bog the Soviets down by fighting a proxy war by arming the Afghan mujahideen.
  During that period, I made a number of trips to Kabul, primarily to interview a series of Moscow-manipulated presidents, all of whom came to violent ends. Each of these trips took me through New Delhi, partly for the connection to Ariana Airlines but also to pick the brains of Indian specialists and government officials. While helpful, these conversations invariably contained two messages: expressions of deep misgivings about yet another instance in which the US was reliant on its Pakistani allies, and stark warnings that the mujahideen would eventually radicalize Afghanistan itself, make common cause with likeminded elements in Pakistan, and turn their jihadist furore on India and, very possibly, on the West.
  So, there it was again—a reminder of how the Cold War had kept morphing in ways that hindered mutual trust, not to mention strategic cooperation, between the US and India.
  Suddenly, in the late 1980s, what John F. Kennedy called the US’s ‘long twilight struggle’ with the Soviet Union ended, first with the reforms of Mikhail Gorbachev, then with collapse of the Berlin Wall, the Iron Curtain, the Warsaw Pact, and, on Christmas Day 1991, the USSR itself.
  Thirteen months later, Bill Clinton was inaugurated as the forty-second President of the United States. He came into office determined to take full advantage of how the world had changed, including by not just improving but transforming US–India relations. He understood that there were twin reasons why these two democracies should pass from estrangement to engagement: one was the end of the Cold War, and the other was India’s reaching out to the world economically and commercially. As deputy secretary of state, first under Warren Christopher, then under Madeleine Albright, I participated in the diplomacy necessary to take advantage of the opportunities that came with these propitious trends.
  My first visit to New Delhi in that capacity came in 1994. I met with Prime Minister Narasimha Rao and his finance minister, Manmohan Singh, who initiated many of the economic reforms that Rakesh Mohan and his fellow contributors analyse in this book.
  The following year, the First Lady, Hillary Clinton, took a long tour of South Asia, concentrating on India. On her return, she told me that she was more convinced than ever that the administration should make ‘a new opening’ to India a hallmark of its foreign policy.
  My most intense experience with India came in the final three years of the Clinton administration. The precipitating event was the May 1998 nuclear tests at Pokhran in the Rajasthan desert, which led to a strategic dialogue consisting of fourteen meetings with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s designated representative, the then minister of external affairs Jaswant Singh. The immediate task was to see if we could narrow the gap between our countries’ security interests and non-proliferation policies, an effort that eventually led to the US–India civil nuclear agreement consummated by the George W. Bush administration and the government of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in 2005.
  But the diplomatic engagement produced another, earlier and, I believe, no less significant achievement: the Indian government’s willingness to permit an American President to involve himself in a conflict between itself and Pakistan. A Pakistani incursion across the Line of Control in the Himalayas in the early spring of 1999 escalated to a full-blown crisis with the potential of going nuclear. Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif made a desperate flight to Washington, hoping for a mediated resolution favourable to Pakistan or at least a face-saving compromise. Intense negotiations were under way in Blair House, across the street from the White House, over the course of the Fourth of July weekend. Meanwhile, in India, Prime Minister Vajpayee feared yet another tilt towards Pakistan. Instead, Bill Clinton succeeded in convincing Nawaz Sharif that there was no alternative to full withdrawal of Pakistani forces back across the Line of Control.
  Once the danger was defused, Jaswant called me from New Delhi. ‘Something terrible has happened these past several months between us and our neighbours,’ he said. ‘But something quite new and good has happened this weekend between our own countries, yours and mine—something related to the matter of trust. My prime minister and I thank your President for that.’
  When Clinton visited India the following March, he made clear to the government, Parliament and the people of India that, in his mind at least, the prospects for the relationship were now in line with the two nations’ interests and values.4
  After my stint in government, I spent an academic year at Yale University, where Nayan Chanda—a friend and fellow journalist whom I had known for decades—and I established the Yale Center for the Study of Globalization. Nayan also founded Yale Global, a web-based journal, that he still edits from New Delhi, an arrangement that is in itself an example of globalization.
  When I came to Brookings in the summer of 2002, I was pleased to discover that my predecessors had long given significant attention to India. In the late 1950s, John P. Lewis, an economist whose career alternated between academe and government, spent considerable time in India and became a far-flung affiliate of Brookings. He had a pied-à-terre in Friends Colony in New Delhi and travelled widely around the country, sending reports back to Brookings for scholars there to use in their own research and public events. The Planning Commission requested that he prepare memoranda for its consideration while it was preparing the Third Five-Year Plan.
  Lewis’s Brookings reports were praised by John Kenneth Galbraith when he arrived in New Delhi as President John F. Kennedy’s ambassador. President Lyndon Johnson later put Lewis in charge of the United States Agency for International Development in India (USAID).
  In the 1960s and 1970s, the Brookings Institution Press published several books on Indian social and economic policy.5 In addition to that encouraging legacy, Brookings has had, since 1988, in Stephen P. Cohen, a world-class expert on South Asia. He, like many Brookings scholars, combined academic distinction and government experience (he served on the State Department’s policy planning office in the Reagan administration).
  Another Brookings scholar, Barry Bosworth, had developed expertise on Asian economies. Two South Asia hands from the Foreign Service Office, whom I had gotten to know in the 1990s, Teresita and Howard Schaffer, have also been affiliated with Brookings.6
  Soon after I had found my sea legs at Brookings, I asked the help of these colleagues in upgrading our work on—and in—India, with the ultimate goal of setting up a Brookings presence there.
  As a first step, we joined with the National Council on Applied Economic Research, then headed by Suman Bery. He, Barry Bosworth and Arvind Panagariya (then affiliated with Brookings as well as Columbia University) founded an annual publication, The India Policy Forum, modelled on The Brookings Papers on Economic Activities, which, for more than forty-five years, has been the premier forum drawing together top economists to write papers and discuss pressing macroeconomic policies.
  I travelled to New Delhi in 2004 for the rollout of the first issue, a well-attended and widely covered event at which Montek Singh Ahluwalia, then deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, delivered an address. The India Policy Forum is now in its thirteenth year.
  It took more than a decade for Martin Indyk, now the executive vice president of Brookings, and Tanvi Madan, the director of our India Project, to achieve our ultimate goal, Brookings India. The realization of this dream was made possible by the generosity, advice and—that word again—engagement of our Founders’ Circle. Also crucial was Vikram Singh Mehta’s willingness to become the chairman of the enterprise and Subir Gokarn providing his own leadership as research director.
  Brookings India cleared all regulatory hurdles and was registered as an Indian non-profit entity in June 2014. Vikram and Subir steered it through this initial phase and then, when Subir moved to Washington DC as India’s executive director on the board of the IMF, Rakesh Mohan, his predecessor there, returned to India and provided the much-needed leadership support in the interim, before departing to teach at Yale. This volume is the result of his endeavours at Brookings. We are now fortunate to have as executive director of Brookings India a leading trade economist, Harsha Vardhana Singh, who, as deputy director general was, for eight years, deputy to Pascal Lamy at the World Trade Organization (WTO).
  The establishment of Brookings India has been made possible by the generous and visionary support of the Brookings India Initiative Founders’ Circle, a group of over thirty donors that believes in the importance of independent policy research at this critical juncture in India’s history. Brookings India started operations in 2013 with support from its Founders’ Circle, each donating equal amounts. This was important to ensure a working environment that no individual or corporation had influence over. The Founders’ Circle has emphasized and encouraged independent research, along the lines of the emphasis by Brookings India scholars on determining their own independent and objective research agenda.
  We look forward to Brookings becoming a mainstream think tank, contributing constructively to the argumentative intellectual and policymaking firmament in India.
  This book has brought together many of the intellectuals, policymakers and business leaders who have contributed to the incredible transformation that has taken place in India over the past quarter century. We hope that it will serve to inspire the next generation leaders who shape India’s destiny in the coming years.
  Rakesh developed the idea of this book, prodded skilfully by Vikram Mehta. He conceived of its content, approached the authors, reviewed and edited the contributions and finalized the manuscript with the publishers. This book is the result of his singular contribution, for which Brookings India owes him a debt of gratitude.

The Road to the 1991 Industrial Policy Reforms and Beyond: A Personalized Narrative from the Trenches
Rakesh Mohan
For those of us beyond the age of fifty, India has been transformed beyond what we might even have dreamt of before the 1990s. In real terms, the Indian economy is now about five times the size it was in 1991. This, of course, does not match the pace of change that the Chinese economy has recorded, which has grown by a factor of ten over the same period and has acquired the status of a global power. Nonetheless, the image of India, and its own self-image, has changed from one of a poverty-ridden, slow-growing, closed economy to that of a fast-growing, open, dynamic one. Though much of the policy focus has been on the economy, change has permeated almost all aspects of life. India now engages with the world on a different plane. The coincident collapse of the Soviet Union opened up new directions for a foreign policy more consistent with a globalizing world. With the acquisition of nuclear capability in the late 1990s, its approach to defence and security has also undergone great transformation. Though much has been achieved, India is still a low–middle income emerging economy and has miles to go before poverty is truly eliminated. Only then will it be able to hold its head high and attain its rightful place in the comity of nations.
  This book chronicles the process of reform in all its different aspects through the eyes of many of the change-makers who have been among the leaders of a resurgent India. The contributors to this volume include some of the key policymakers of the period who designed and implemented the reforms; business leaders who grasped the new opportunities that emerged and built some of India’s most successful businesses; and analysts and observers who have been among the most critical and thoughtful of this tribe.
  In this introductory chapter, I focus on how it all started: the genesis and implementation of the 1991 industrial policy reforms, which constituted a transformational break with the long-standing ‘command-and-control’ Indian economic policy stance that had broadly survived since Independence. I have had the privilege of being associated with the overall process in different ways, on a continuous basis from 1990 till 2015, but most closely with the design and implementation of the original comprehensive industrial policy reform of 1991. Though this was only one segment of the comprehensive reforms that have been in process over the whole period since 1991, it was symbolic of the mindset change that has contributed to India’s new economic trajectory. It is important to understand how such a change took place; hence, this detailed account of the process of change that really started in the early 1980s.
  There have been a number of accounts narrating the process with which the 1991 reforms were initiated. These accounts have essentially given a top-down view of what transpired during that time. What I propose to do is to give a much more workmanlike, technocratic view of how the industrial policy reforms were initiated and then implemented in 1991. In some sense, this is a worm’s-eye view from the trenches, where much of the work was done. I leave the larger political questions to those who were nearer the political decision-making process.1 Since the 1991 economic reforms were a clear break from the direction followed in the previous forty years since Independence, how was it that such reforms could take place? There was no ideological break as exemplified by the ascendance of Margaret Thatcher in the UK and Ronald Reagan in the US, which led to the spread of market fundamentalism in the world in the 1980s; or the market-oriented big-bang lurch in the hitherto socialist countries in Eastern Europe and Russia, which took place after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1990. In India, it was the same Congress party that had presided over the central-planning-dominated, import-substituting Licence Permit Raj earlier, which ushered in the new India in 1991. Moreover, the progenitors of the 1991 reforms were a trio of self-effacing leaders: Prime Minister Narasimha Rao provided the political leadership; Finance Minister Manmohan Singh the intellectual and technocratic heft; and Principal Secretary Amar Nath Verma was the indispensable bureaucratic enforcer. How did this happen? In this essay, I attempt to provide some answers to this question by giving a detailed genesis of the industrial policy reform that formed the backbone of reforms of 1991. To quote Finance Minister Manmohan Singh’s 1991 budget speech (citing Victor Hugo): ‘No power on earth can stop an idea whose time has come.’
  But let me start with some of the questions that have typically engaged observers of the reforms:
* Who was more responsible for the 1991 reforms: Prime Minister Narasimha Rao or Finance Minister Manmohan Singh?
* Were these reforms home-grown or were they pushed down India’s throat by the IMF and the World Bank?
* How was it that such radical reforms could be undertaken at that time despite long-lasting resistance by the Indian political and bureaucratic elites for a very long time?
Until recently, the general view had given Finance Minister Manmohan Singh the pride of place as the key driver of reforms during the 1991–96 period. However, the revisionist view now gives greater prominence to the role of Narasimha Rao in actually getting the 1991 reforms politically accepted and implemented.2 It was clearly a partnership: Manmohan Singh certainly provided the intellectual leadership to the comprehensive nature of economic reforms carried out over that five-year period, while Narasimha Rao’s political sagacity, management skills and courage were essential to the reform project. It was perhaps his very lack of flamboyance and charisma that provided the necessary gravitas that made political acceptance feasible. And he clearly gave full, explicit political backing to Manmohan Singh to do what had to be done. The fact that, since the early 1970s, Manmohan Singh had held every conceivable leadership position in the Ministry of Finance, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Planning Commission—the highest organs of economic policymaking in the government—provided confidence in the measures that were taken.
  This was certainly an unlikely team to carry out the radical changes in economic policies that were implemented. Both of them were known much more as loyal deputies to the Congress leadership from Indira Gandhi’s time and neither was particularly known for decisive leadership. Both certainly rose to the occasion and delivered the country from a serious economic crisis and set it on a sustainable high-growth path that has lasted for twenty-five years so far, despite a number of changes in the government over this period. But it was the third member of the team who is seldom given credit for what transpired during that five-year period—Principal Secretary Amar Nath Verma—whose role was crucial to the implementation of economic reforms. Despite no previous familiarity between the two, it was providential that Narasimha Rao appointed him as his principal secretary: he clearly turned out to be the right man for the right job at the right time.
  As I relate below, it was Verma who was responsible for the initiation of industrial policy reforms much earlier as industry secretary, so he could usher in the radical reforms in no time once given the opportunity. Perhaps even more important, having gained success in implementing this radical reform, he acquired enough confidence to be the enforcer of the economic reforms regime over the next five years.
  Thus, it was this unlikely trio that should be given somewhat equal credit for what transpired in the economic policy realm between 1991 and 1996.
  I am not qualified to say much more on the first question, and I leave it to those who were nearer the political decision-making process at the top at that time to give a clear verdict.3 In his chapter in this volume, T.N. Ninan4 has provided an insightful political-economy framework, within which the economic reforms have been carried out (and constrained) in India.
  Could these reforms have been accomplished without the pressure of the IMF and the World Bank? Possibly not. There is nothing like a crisis to focus the political and bureaucratic mind. But then, there is no shortage of crises that different countries have suffered over the last half-century or so: in fact, more than 100 countries have suffered such crises and have been subjected to IMF programmes. If they had all succeeded in carrying out IMF-imposed programmes, the world would perhaps be a much better place now!
  After the excesses of the late 1980s, the dual balance-of-payments and fiscal crises had been building up in India for a couple of years before 1991, but action could not be taken because of the then ongoing political instability in the country. By the time the new government came to power on 21 June 1991 the economic situation was dire—inflation was well into double digits and foreign-exchange reserves had hit rock bottom; something just had to be done. In their contributions to this volume, C. Rangarajan5 and Montek Singh Ahluwalia provide vivid first-person accounts of the macroeconomic mess that the country found itself in 1991. The IMF and World Bank pressure was undeniable. However, resorting to an IMF programme in 1981–82 had not resulted in a similar well-organized reform programme. The balance-of-payment difficulties arising from the oil price increase in 1989–90 had necessitated the use of a loan of SDR 3.9 billion from the IMF’s ‘Extended Fund Facility’ at that time.
  This time it succeeded because, as I document, there was actually an emerging technocratic consensus on the direction of reforms over the previous decade or so. Moreover, the collapse of the Soviet Union in the previous year added to the Reagan–Thatcher ideological winds that had been blowing in the 1980s. The 1980s also saw developing countries launching economic reforms—the so-called wave of structural adjustment programmes. The East Asian miracle was grounded in more liberal industrial and trade regimes with an export focus. Dr Manmohan Singh has also talked of how his work for the South Commission raised his awareness of how East Asia was progressing relative to India. The world was changing around us, and we became aware that we were being left behind.
  A great deal of work had been done towards liberalization within different arms of the economic policy establishment during the 1980s. So, in some sense, the country was ready and a good part of the reform programme was indeed home-grown. Montek Ahluwalia has provided an overview of the overall reform programme in his chapter.6 My general conclusion is that the reforms were much more home-grown than often thought by observers.
  With this general background, I now focus on one aspect of the programme, the industrial policy reforms of 1991, as an illustration of the domestic generation of the overall reform process. These reforms were somewhat different in that they were comprehensive in the industry policy realm and were carried out in one shot on 24 July 1991, less than five weeks after the new government came into power. Most of the other reforms had to be done over a period of time: fiscal, trade, monetary and financial sector policy reforms were carried out gradually over the next decade or so.
My Personal Journey to the 1991 Industrial Policy Reforms
I first came back to India in 1980 to work as a ‘senior consultant’ on urban development in the Planning Commission, after having spent almost sixteen years abroad. It was Professor Raj Krishna, as a member of the Morarji Desai government’s Planning Commission, who, in 1979, had invited me to come to the commission in recognition of my work on housing and urban development with the World Bank. At that time, there was very little work in the country on urbanization and its attendant problems; hence, the interest in inviting me to the commission. By late 1980, when I was finally able to extricate myself from the large multiyear research project that I was involved in, ‘The City Study’ on Bogota and Cali, Colombia, and obtained leave from the World Bank, the government had changed and Professor Raj Krishna had returned to academia. In those days of a relatively depoliticized Planning Commission, my appointment was honoured but no one in the commission really knew why I had arrived when I did and what I was supposed to. Those were the days when people like me, returning to India from abroad, from institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, were viewed with suspicion. In fact, the welcome greeting I received from a senior member of the administration on the first day went something like this: ‘Why have you come here? Is there something wrong with you? Or is there some problem in your family? Why would you leave a cushy job in the World Bank to come here? You know that we don’t treat people like you well here!’7
  I survived all this and worked exclusively on housing and urban development for three years before returning to the World Bank after my leave ended. There was really very little interest shown in what I was doing except for Dr Manmohan Singh who was then the member secretary of the Planning Commission. To keep me busy, and perhaps to get me out of his hair, he agreed to appoint four task forces on housing and urban development, with me as the member secretary to each of them.
  This turned out to be a very rewarding experience for me, since the members of each of the task forces were senior civil servants engaged in housing and urban development issues, and other independent experts and academics from across the country. Each of the meetings of the task forces was held in different cities of the country, so I was also able to get familiarity with the working of state and city governments, as also some personal knowledge of our main cities. From my perch at the Planning Commission, I was able to get to know most of the senior economists in the country as well. As someone who lived abroad from the age of sixteen to thirty-two, this was indeed a great opportunity. The result was preparation of four comprehensive task-force reports on planning, financing and management of urban development, and on housing and shelter for the urban poor, which attempted to provide a blueprint for what was needed to anticipate the course of urbanization in the country for the following twenty years or so, and the approach that needed to be adopted. These reports did arouse a great deal of interest among the cognoscenti of urban development, but did not succeed in catching the attention of mainstream policymakers, and hence, were essentially buried in the archives of the Planning Commission. The one concrete result was the founding of the National Housing Bank, which was an indirect descendent of one of the recommendations of the Task Force on Financing of Urban Development, chaired by the redoubtable Raja Chelliah.8
  However, having achieved what I came out to do, I returned to the World Bank at the end of my three-year leave. I also concluded that the time was not ripe for policy work in urban development in India. There were too many moving parts in the system between the central, state and urban local governments and too few policy instruments at the central level to be effective and, in any case, too little interest. Consequently, I decided that I needed to retrain myself and work on more mainstream policy areas, such as industrial and trade policy, and on macroeconomic policy.
  After returning to the World Bank in late 1983, I spent a year finishing the earlier work on the City Study, which resulted in two full-fledged monographs on the ‘developing metropolis’. It was then time to move on and abandon urban development. I was fortunate to get appointed as a senior country economist in the World Bank’s Philippines division in early 1985. This was a momentous time for the Philippines when the transition took place from President Marcos to President Aquino, and the IMF and the World Bank got active in designing macro-stabilization and structural adjustment programmes for the country. Among other activities at the macro level I was designated to lead a large team to design industrial policy reforms. This was fortuitous as it gave me some idea of the policy process involved in designing countrywide macroeconomic strategy, including tax reforms, but particularly focused on industrial policy.
  Meanwhile, in India, after Indira Gandhi’s assassination, her successor Rajiv Gandhi appointed Dr Manmohan Singh as the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission. Just as I was completing the industrial strategy report for the Philippines in 1986, I got a call from him to return to India to join the Planning Commission as one of the three economic advisers in the newly formed development policy division in the commission. I readily agreed and returned to India at the end of 1986. This was a prescient attempt by the then deputy chairman Dr Manmohan Singh to begin the transformation of the Planning Commission towards a greater and active role in formulating policy. It is ironic that twenty-eight years after that largely failed initiative, the whole Planning Commission has now been transformed into the NITI Aayog, the ‘Policy Commission’!
  The development policy division never really took off, especially after Dr Manmohan Singh got appointed to the South Commission in Geneva and left in late 1987. But with members such as Abid Hussain, Yoginder Alagh and Raja Chelliah, and advisers such as old-timer Nitin Desai, newly appointed economic advisers, Arvind Virmani and Srinivas Madhur, and Jairam Ramesh9 for company, that commission was an intellectually absorbing place to be. Abid Hussain,10 in particular, as one of the early liberalizers, was constantly pushing the policy envelope and consistently on the lookout for new ideas. He encouraged each of us to contribute: Srinivas Madhur assisted him on a committee on capital markets; among other activities, he asked me to assist him as member secretary in a High-Level Committee (HLC) on Restructuring the Textile Industry, and later in a similar capacity in an HLC on Industrial Exports.11 Both these roles brought me into direct contact with industrial policy as it was at the time, and also brought me face-to-face with the powerful vested interests as they existed in trade unions, incumbent industrialists and in the entrenched bureaucracy. The work for the textile committee, which included a research project that I commissioned Omkar Goswami (one of the contributors to this volume) to do, brought home to me in very vivid form how irrational and dysfunctional our industrial control system was. In the garb of protecting employment, it had essentially succeeded in almost destroying an industry that was once India’s pride. To give but one example: a weaving mill was not allowed to replace an ageing loom without specific permission from the textile commissioner, in the interest of protecting employment in handlooms. Thus, little investment took place and much of the textile industry in India was either aged or deceased by the late 1980s. India lost its place in the global textile industry, ceding its place to East and South East Asian countries and lately to Bangladesh.
  With this experience whetting my appetite for more active policy work, and the development policy division in the Planning Commission becoming increasingly moribund, I was on the lookout for a more regular mainstream economic adviser appointment. I was also keen to avoid returning to the arid confines of the World Bank in Washington. I was pipped to the post of economic adviser in the Ministry of Commerce by my friend Jayanta Roy,12 but then came the providential opportunity to become economic adviser in the Ministry of Industry in late 1988. I jumped at it as I felt qualified enough to do this after the experience I had had in charting industrial strategy for the Philippines and my industry-related work in the Planning Commission. Moreover, although the Philippines itself was seen as the sick man of Asia, I had become fascinated by the unfolding East Asian miracle and had taken pains to familiarize myself with the successful macro, industrial and trade policies of the East Asian tigers.
  This turned out to be another challenge as the ministry had not had an effective economic adviser for some years, so his role had become restricted to compilation of the weekly wholesale price index and routine analysis of the index of industrial production, and hence far removed from policy issues. I therefore busied myself by doing research on the extant industrial policy and how it had evolved since Independence. India had been known to have among the most complex and comprehensive command-and-control economic systems, which was known pejoratively as the Licence Permit Raj. The result of my labours was a comprehensive paper co-authored with my colleague Vandana Aggarwal, who was then a young senior research officer from the Indian Economic Service.13 This turned out to be fortuitous as it provided a pretty comprehensive understanding of the origins of the Indian economic control system as it operated at the time, and enabled me to insert myself in the ministry’s policymaking process when the opportunity came later. I also learnt a great deal about how the control system really worked by participating in the myriad of committees that an entrepreneur had to negotiate before he would actually invest in a new industrial project.
  From my personal viewpoint, this was the beginning of the process of what later culminated in the 1991 industrial policy reforms.
  Given the transformational changes that have taken place since then, it is useful to relate what I found: how the system actually operated even as late as the late 1980s, and how desperate the need for reforms were.
