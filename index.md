Preface
This book should have been published in 2016 when the country completed twenty-five years of economic reforms. That was our intention, but it was clearly too ambitious to expect success in producing such a book within eight months of the inception of the idea. But, better late than never.
  I have been fortunate to have had the opportunity to serve the Government of India in a host of different capacities throughout the reform period from 1991 until late 2015. For a professional economist, nothing can be more exciting and gratifying than being part of a policy process that sets a country on a sustainable growth path that lasts over a long period. India has already grown at an average annual rate of around 6.5 per cent for almost thirty-five years. This was a significant acceleration over the anaemic rate of 3–3.5 per cent over the previous thirty-five years. We can hope that such a process will continue and even accelerate to the next stage at near 10 per cent over the next quarter century and beyond. As documented by the World Bank’s growth commission, since 1950, only thirteen countries have exhibited annual growth rates of 7 per cent or more for a period of twenty-five years or longer. India hasn’t quite joined this exclusive group but it must be our collective endeavour to do so in the coming years. That is the challenge facing the next generation of economic strategy, reform processes and performance.
  This is therefore a good time to chronicle the kind of change that the country has experienced over this past quarter century. In some areas the change has been truly transformative, while in others, much more could have been done, particularly in the areas of health, education and agriculture. What reforms were carried out and how do they affect the country? What were our expectations in 1991? What has been achieved, and what not? And, where do we go from here? These are the kind of questions that we set out to address as we started work on this book.
  Through my thirty years being in and around the government, I have had the good fortune of being associated in different ways with each of the remarkable individuals who have contributed to this book. I have called upon our bonds of friendship to persuade each of these busy individuals to reflect on their experience as they have transformed themselves, their respective organizations and their country over these twenty-five years. This book brings together thirty technocratic leaders who have participated in this exciting project of nation-building since the early 1990s. This group includes some of the key policymakers and advisers, academics, industry leaders, opinion makers and commentators. Each of them has made key contributions over this period to bring India where it is today. They have worked in their respective fields consistently, and retained their credibility and commitment across a succession of diverse governments of different political persuasions. They have displayed professionalism of the highest order in their respective areas of operations.
  My greatest debt of gratitude goes to each of these impressive individuals who, in their folly, agreed to engage and commit their time to contributing to this collection. Given the many different pursuits that they are engaged in, it has been an act of considerable generosity to submit to the tortuous process that goes into the publication of any book. Each of them submitted to the various revisions that I subjected them to, somewhat cheerfully, and then to the professional editing process that followed.
  Hence, my heartfelt appreciation for this act of friendship expressed by each of the contributors.
  Vikram Mehta, in his role as chairman of Brookings India, must shoulder the blame for setting me on this task. As I returned to India in late 2015, after serving as executive director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), he asked me to babysit Brookings India in early 2016 as he hunted for a full-time successor to Subir Gokarn who had led Brookings India from its inception in 2013, and who had to leave to succeed me at the IMF. As I took up my position in Brookings India, he thought I should also do something more substantive. He came up with the idea that Brookings India should do something to commemorate twenty-five years of reforms. Foolishly, I agreed readily. Then ensued a number of discussions of what this task would entail; and the idea of this collection emerged. My sincere thanks to Vikram for setting me up for doing this and then providing unstinting support, both personally and institutionally. This included active prodding of some recalcitrant authors.
  I have received consistent support from Nitika Mehta, the head of development and communications, and Shruti Gakhar, the development and communications officer at Brookings India, throughout the fifteen months or so that this project has taken. Nitika was instrumental in convincing Penguin Random House to publish this volume; how she did so remains a mystery to me since it agreed to do so even before there was any content available. Shruti has been diligently keeping track of each draft article at every stage and has kept all communications with both authors and the editors in good order. Together, they have been the chief interlocutors with the publishers and authors. Along with the publishers, they are also responsible for managing the communications strategy for promotion of the book. My sincere thanks for their consistent and devoted diligence to these tasks which have been far beyond their normal calls of duty at Brookings.
  My academic home is now at the Jackson Institute for Global Affairs at Yale University. Most of the work on this volume was done over the 2016–17 academic year at Yale. My sincere thanks go to Jim Levinsohn, the director of the Jackson Institute, for inviting me back to teach at Yale. The quiet, salubrious and supportive environment at the institute was very helpful in getting this task done. As it happens, the finishing touches to my last book were also done at the Jackson Institute in Yale in 2010.
  The team at Penguin Random House, led by Meru Gokhale, has been remarkable in the kind of support they have provided which has involved interaction with thirty-two authors. They have been consistently patient and cooperative. Anushree Kaushal has led the editorial team, supported by Rachita Raj and Shanuj V.C.; and Preeti Chaturvedi has led the promotion efforts for the book. My gratitude to all at Penguin who have made this book possible.
  I also owe a debt of gratitude to the time and effort that Ritu Vajpeyi-Mohan has devoted to educating me in the art of bookmaking and promotion.
  After he took over at Brookings India as executive director, Harsha Vardhana Singh has provided continual encouragement for this enterprise, apart from making his own path-breaking contribution on trade. My sincere thanks.
  Finally, I must thank Strobe Talbott for his support as president of Brookings in Washington, and specifically for agreeing to contribute his perspective—from a distance—on India’s transformation.
  My family has been almost oblivious to the work that I have been doing on this book! But my intensive engagement in policymaking over the past quarter century and frequent intercontinental movement between India and the United States over the past five years, would not have been possible without their collective forbearance, active support, tolerance and inspiration. My wife, Rasika, has been a tower of strength, especially in the last few years of extreme trial and tribulation, providing me with great cheerfulness, the environment of peace and tranquillity that is essential for undertaking such an endeavour. Tarini, my daughter, inspires us all with her continuing battle against adversity; and Rasesh, my son, gives us consistent support without compromising his own professional goals. His equanimity in the face of many competing professional and personal demands is a lesson on how to keep focus on the essentials.
  I dedicate this book to my family: Rasika, Tarini and Rasesh.
 
 
Foreword
Strobe Talbott
This timely, authoritative and policy-relevant volume sheds light on India’s dramatic changes over the past quarter century. That transformation has not only been a boon to the people of India, it has also contributed to the progress of the human enterprise as a whole. The world’s largest democracy is a major player on the world stage. It is certainly viewed and valued that way by my own country, the United States of America.
  The economic and commercial dimension of India’s evolution is, of course, crucial. Hence, the focus of submissions in the pages that follow is political economy, financial development, trade and globalization, technology and innovation, agricultural and industrial development, and the interaction between the private and public sectors. The contributors include some of the original designers and implementers of the reform process, along with the prominent business leaders who have been the most successful builders of the economy.
  There is also, thanks to the inclusion of wisdom from Shivshankar Menon, Shyam Saran and Sanjaya Baru, due attention paid to India’s foreign and security policy.
  Over the course of the last half-century, I have had numerous opportunities to watch India’s evolution, first from the vantage point of a student of international relations and then for two decades as a journalist. During my eight years in government during the 1990s, I also had a chance to participate in the effort by the Indian and the US governments to put the bilateral relationship on a sounder—indeed, a transformed—footing than had been the case in the first four decades after Indian Independence. Dennis Kux captured the perception on both sides of that star-crossed backstory in the subtitle of his 1992 book, India and the United States: Estranged Democracies.1
  What stymied a robust bond between these two countries? After all, both had wrested their independence from British rule while adopting and adapting many of the features of British constitutional governance (minus, of course, the monarchy).
  The key factor, I’ve always believed, was the Cold War.
  It was approximately at the midpoint of that global schism that I first visited India forty-two years ago. I owe that enriching and informative experience to a glitch in my career as a Sovietologist.
  In those days, I was a reporter for Time magazine concentrating on East–West relations and was assigned to the State Department beat. This often meant whirling around the world, coping with what seemed like a permanent case of jetlag, trying to keep up with the then secretary of state Henry Kissinger.
  In October 1974, Kissinger embarked on a seven-nation diplomatic tour starting with Moscow. The Kremlin was eager to welcome the secretary of state as the personification of continuity in the US policy of détente, in the wake of Richard Nixon’s resignation and Gerald Ford’s ascension to the presidency. The Soviets, however, were not about to extend their hospitality to me. I was persona non grata because of my role in translating and editing Nikita Khrushchev’s memoirs. The material for the two volumes was surreptitiously recorded and spirited out of the country while he was under virtual house arrest, since his ouster from the leadership ten years before. The second volume, published earlier in 1974, particularly irked Foreign Minister Anatoly Gromyko, who sent a message to Kissinger’s plane over the Atlantic, denying me a visa.2
  After I was unceremoniously dropped off in Copenhagen during a fuelling stop, I hopscotched to New Delhi, which would be Kissinger’s second stop after Moscow.
  On the personal front, my several days of free time were immensely gratifying. I made friendships that lasted for decades. I also came to know Ambassador Daniel Patrick Moynihan (whose desk officer at the State Department was none other than Dennis Kux). Moynihan’s wife, Elizabeth, took me under her wing and drove me out to—where else?—the Taj Mahal, where she was already deeply into studying the Mughal gardens.
  In the course of numerous interviews and briefings I had in New Delhi while Kissinger was still in Moscow, I was struck by the deep-rooted and long-simmering tensions in the official relations between the US and Indian governments. These went back to the 1950s, when India’s role as a founder of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) put it at odds with America’s self-assigned leadership of the Free World (a phrase also capitalized in those days). In the aftermath of independence from the Raj, Indian leaders were wary of another Western power claiming a sphere of influence on which the sun would never set. From the official American perspective, India’s purchase of MiGs for its air force and adoption of Soviet-inspired Five-Year Plans led policymakers such as Secretary of State John Foster Dulles to question whose side this giant Asian country was really on.
  Even before Henry Kissinger made his first official visit to India, he had already attracted the eye of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. She was still bristling over the Nixon administration’s refusal, three years before, to support India’s intervention in the Bangladesh Liberation War. The columnist Jack Anderson publicized leaked government documents that exposed Kissinger’s critical sentiments about India and, in particular, Mrs Gandhi.3
  On the US side, there was concern and disapproval of India’s ‘Smiling Buddha’ underground test of a nuclear device earlier in May 1974 (just a little over three months before the Kissinger mission). American protestations exacerbated Indian resentments.
  While Kissinger’s plane was en route from Moscow to New Delhi, Mrs Gandhi gave a press conference denigrating the importance of the impending visit and thereby the visitor himself. To accentuate the snub, she announced that she would be giving the American secretary of state only forty-five minutes of her time before leaving on vacation.
  As though that wasn’t bad enough, Kissinger had to spend three days in India. He put on a brave and polite face in public, but he was furious, not least because he had to a give a speech to a New Delhi foreign-policy organization on non-alignment, a subject he hated in general but particularly in the case of India, given its cordial relations with the Soviet Union.
  Once, to his undisguised relief, Kissinger was back aboard his Air Force Boeing 707 and was leaving New Delhi behind, he came from his luxurious suite behind the cockpit to the back of the plane. That’s where the press corps (including me, now reinstated) was crammed into economy-class seats, pens poised and notebooks ready for a background readout on the diplomatic downer from ‘a senior American official on Secretary Kissinger’s plane’.
  Kissinger had clearly not gotten over his annoyance at Mrs Gandhi. Yet, he also allowed that she was a formidable politician and, like himself, a hard-headed realist.
  Leaving personalities aside, he mused about what underlay ‘the chronic disharmony’ between Washington and New Delhi. He saw it as a regional manifestation of a global division between two ideological and geopolitical camps: India’s uneasy, often conflicted, relationship with Pakistan was vexing and dangerous in its own right, but all the more so given the not-inaccurate perception in New Delhi that the US ‘tilted’ towards Pakistan, and the equally defensible sense in Washington that India leaned toward Moscow—to wit, India’s Soviet-designed military aircraft, not to mention its reliance on five-year economic plans of the sort favoured by Fabian socialists.
  Kissinger was turning his attention to Pakistan because it would be one of the next stops on the trip. In contrast to Mrs Gandhi, he knew that Zulfikar Ali Bhutto would treat him royally. There would be no talk of non-alignment there.
  The secretary concluded his airborne seminar with the reporters by remarking that a genuine partnership between the US and India would be impossible as long as the Cold War lasted. All of us, including him, expected that to be for a very long time, most probably well past our own lifetimes and maybe our children’s. Little did we know that the USSR would last just long enough to reach the biblical lifespan of a single mortal: three score and ten years. The prologue of its demise—though we didn’t realize it as such—came in the form of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979. The administration of Jimmy Carter saw a chance to bog the Soviets down by fighting a proxy war by arming the Afghan mujahideen.
  During that period, I made a number of trips to Kabul, primarily to interview a series of Moscow-manipulated presidents, all of whom came to violent ends. Each of these trips took me through New Delhi, partly for the connection to Ariana Airlines but also to pick the brains of Indian specialists and government officials. While helpful, these conversations invariably contained two messages: expressions of deep misgivings about yet another instance in which the US was reliant on its Pakistani allies, and stark warnings that the mujahideen would eventually radicalize Afghanistan itself, make common cause with likeminded elements in Pakistan, and turn their jihadist furore on India and, very possibly, on the West.
  So, there it was again—a reminder of how the Cold War had kept morphing in ways that hindered mutual trust, not to mention strategic cooperation, between the US and India.
  Suddenly, in the late 1980s, what John F. Kennedy called the US’s ‘long twilight struggle’ with the Soviet Union ended, first with the reforms of Mikhail Gorbachev, then with collapse of the Berlin Wall, the Iron Curtain, the Warsaw Pact, and, on Christmas Day 1991, the USSR itself.
  Thirteen months later, Bill Clinton was inaugurated as the forty-second President of the United States. He came into office determined to take full advantage of how the world had changed, including by not just improving but transforming US–India relations. He understood that there were twin reasons why these two democracies should pass from estrangement to engagement: one was the end of the Cold War, and the other was India’s reaching out to the world economically and commercially. As deputy secretary of state, first under Warren Christopher, then under Madeleine Albright, I participated in the diplomacy necessary to take advantage of the opportunities that came with these propitious trends.
  My first visit to New Delhi in that capacity came in 1994. I met with Prime Minister Narasimha Rao and his finance minister, Manmohan Singh, who initiated many of the economic reforms that Rakesh Mohan and his fellow contributors analyse in this book.
  The following year, the First Lady, Hillary Clinton, took a long tour of South Asia, concentrating on India. On her return, she told me that she was more convinced than ever that the administration should make ‘a new opening’ to India a hallmark of its foreign policy.
  My most intense experience with India came in the final three years of the Clinton administration. The precipitating event was the May 1998 nuclear tests at Pokhran in the Rajasthan desert, which led to a strategic dialogue consisting of fourteen meetings with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s designated representative, the then minister of external affairs Jaswant Singh. The immediate task was to see if we could narrow the gap between our countries’ security interests and non-proliferation policies, an effort that eventually led to the US–India civil nuclear agreement consummated by the George W. Bush administration and the government of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in 2005.
  But the diplomatic engagement produced another, earlier and, I believe, no less significant achievement: the Indian government’s willingness to permit an American President to involve himself in a conflict between itself and Pakistan. A Pakistani incursion across the Line of Control in the Himalayas in the early spring of 1999 escalated to a full-blown crisis with the potential of going nuclear. Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif made a desperate flight to Washington, hoping for a mediated resolution favourable to Pakistan or at least a face-saving compromise. Intense negotiations were under way in Blair House, across the street from the White House, over the course of the Fourth of July weekend. Meanwhile, in India, Prime Minister Vajpayee feared yet another tilt towards Pakistan. Instead, Bill Clinton succeeded in convincing Nawaz Sharif that there was no alternative to full withdrawal of Pakistani forces back across the Line of Control.
  Once the danger was defused, Jaswant called me from New Delhi. ‘Something terrible has happened these past several months between us and our neighbours,’ he said. ‘But something quite new and good has happened this weekend between our own countries, yours and mine—something related to the matter of trust. My prime minister and I thank your President for that.’
  When Clinton visited India the following March, he made clear to the government, Parliament and the people of India that, in his mind at least, the prospects for the relationship were now in line with the two nations’ interests and values.4
  After my stint in government, I spent an academic year at Yale University, where Nayan Chanda—a friend and fellow journalist whom I had known for decades—and I established the Yale Center for the Study of Globalization. Nayan also founded Yale Global, a web-based journal, that he still edits from New Delhi, an arrangement that is in itself an example of globalization.
  When I came to Brookings in the summer of 2002, I was pleased to discover that my predecessors had long given significant attention to India. In the late 1950s, John P. Lewis, an economist whose career alternated between academe and government, spent considerable time in India and became a far-flung affiliate of Brookings. He had a pied-à-terre in Friends Colony in New Delhi and travelled widely around the country, sending reports back to Brookings for scholars there to use in their own research and public events. The Planning Commission requested that he prepare memoranda for its consideration while it was preparing the Third Five-Year Plan.
  Lewis’s Brookings reports were praised by John Kenneth Galbraith when he arrived in New Delhi as President John F. Kennedy’s ambassador. President Lyndon Johnson later put Lewis in charge of the United States Agency for International Development in India (USAID).
  In the 1960s and 1970s, the Brookings Institution Press published several books on Indian social and economic policy.5 In addition to that encouraging legacy, Brookings has had, since 1988, in Stephen P. Cohen, a world-class expert on South Asia. He, like many Brookings scholars, combined academic distinction and government experience (he served on the State Department’s policy planning office in the Reagan administration).
  Another Brookings scholar, Barry Bosworth, had developed expertise on Asian economies. Two South Asia hands from the Foreign Service Office, whom I had gotten to know in the 1990s, Teresita and Howard Schaffer, have also been affiliated with Brookings.6
  Soon after I had found my sea legs at Brookings, I asked the help of these colleagues in upgrading our work on—and in—India, with the ultimate goal of setting up a Brookings presence there.
  As a first step, we joined with the National Council on Applied Economic Research, then headed by Suman Bery. He, Barry Bosworth and Arvind Panagariya (then affiliated with Brookings as well as Columbia University) founded an annual publication, The India Policy Forum, modelled on The Brookings Papers on Economic Activities, which, for more than forty-five years, has been the premier forum drawing together top economists to write papers and discuss pressing macroeconomic policies.
  I travelled to New Delhi in 2004 for the rollout of the first issue, a well-attended and widely covered event at which Montek Singh Ahluwalia, then deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, delivered an address. The India Policy Forum is now in its thirteenth year.
  It took more than a decade for Martin Indyk, now the executive vice president of Brookings, and Tanvi Madan, the director of our India Project, to achieve our ultimate goal, Brookings India. The realization of this dream was made possible by the generosity, advice and—that word again—engagement of our Founders’ Circle. Also crucial was Vikram Singh Mehta’s willingness to become the chairman of the enterprise and Subir Gokarn providing his own leadership as research director.
  Brookings India cleared all regulatory hurdles and was registered as an Indian non-profit entity in June 2014. Vikram and Subir steered it through this initial phase and then, when Subir moved to Washington DC as India’s executive director on the board of the IMF, Rakesh Mohan, his predecessor there, returned to India and provided the much-needed leadership support in the interim, before departing to teach at Yale. This volume is the result of his endeavours at Brookings. We are now fortunate to have as executive director of Brookings India a leading trade economist, Harsha Vardhana Singh, who, as deputy director general was, for eight years, deputy to Pascal Lamy at the World Trade Organization (WTO).
  The establishment of Brookings India has been made possible by the generous and visionary support of the Brookings India Initiative Founders’ Circle, a group of over thirty donors that believes in the importance of independent policy research at this critical juncture in India’s history. Brookings India started operations in 2013 with support from its Founders’ Circle, each donating equal amounts. This was important to ensure a working environment that no individual or corporation had influence over. The Founders’ Circle has emphasized and encouraged independent research, along the lines of the emphasis by Brookings India scholars on determining their own independent and objective research agenda.
  We look forward to Brookings becoming a mainstream think tank, contributing constructively to the argumentative intellectual and policymaking firmament in India.
  This book has brought together many of the intellectuals, policymakers and business leaders who have contributed to the incredible transformation that has taken place in India over the past quarter century. We hope that it will serve to inspire the next generation leaders who shape India’s destiny in the coming years.
  Rakesh developed the idea of this book, prodded skilfully by Vikram Mehta. He conceived of its content, approached the authors, reviewed and edited the contributions and finalized the manuscript with the publishers. This book is the result of his singular contribution, for which Brookings India owes him a debt of gratitude.

The Road to the 1991 Industrial Policy Reforms and Beyond: A Personalized Narrative from the Trenches
Rakesh Mohan
For those of us beyond the age of fifty, India has been transformed beyond what we might even have dreamt of before the 1990s. In real terms, the Indian economy is now about five times the size it was in 1991. This, of course, does not match the pace of change that the Chinese economy has recorded, which has grown by a factor of ten over the same period and has acquired the status of a global power. Nonetheless, the image of India, and its own self-image, has changed from one of a poverty-ridden, slow-growing, closed economy to that of a fast-growing, open, dynamic one. Though much of the policy focus has been on the economy, change has permeated almost all aspects of life. India now engages with the world on a different plane. The coincident collapse of the Soviet Union opened up new directions for a foreign policy more consistent with a globalizing world. With the acquisition of nuclear capability in the late 1990s, its approach to defence and security has also undergone great transformation. Though much has been achieved, India is still a low–middle income emerging economy and has miles to go before poverty is truly eliminated. Only then will it be able to hold its head high and attain its rightful place in the comity of nations.
  This book chronicles the process of reform in all its different aspects through the eyes of many of the change-makers who have been among the leaders of a resurgent India. The contributors to this volume include some of the key policymakers of the period who designed and implemented the reforms; business leaders who grasped the new opportunities that emerged and built some of India’s most successful businesses; and analysts and observers who have been among the most critical and thoughtful of this tribe.
  In this introductory chapter, I focus on how it all started: the genesis and implementation of the 1991 industrial policy reforms, which constituted a transformational break with the long-standing ‘command-and-control’ Indian economic policy stance that had broadly survived since Independence. I have had the privilege of being associated with the overall process in different ways, on a continuous basis from 1990 till 2015, but most closely with the design and implementation of the original comprehensive industrial policy reform of 1991. Though this was only one segment of the comprehensive reforms that have been in process over the whole period since 1991, it was symbolic of the mindset change that has contributed to India’s new economic trajectory. It is important to understand how such a change took place; hence, this detailed account of the process of change that really started in the early 1980s.
  There have been a number of accounts narrating the process with which the 1991 reforms were initiated. These accounts have essentially given a top-down view of what transpired during that time. What I propose to do is to give a much more workmanlike, technocratic view of how the industrial policy reforms were initiated and then implemented in 1991. In some sense, this is a worm’s-eye view from the trenches, where much of the work was done. I leave the larger political questions to those who were nearer the political decision-making process.1 Since the 1991 economic reforms were a clear break from the direction followed in the previous forty years since Independence, how was it that such reforms could take place? There was no ideological break as exemplified by the ascendance of Margaret Thatcher in the UK and Ronald Reagan in the US, which led to the spread of market fundamentalism in the world in the 1980s; or the market-oriented big-bang lurch in the hitherto socialist countries in Eastern Europe and Russia, which took place after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1990. In India, it was the same Congress party that had presided over the central-planning-dominated, import-substituting Licence Permit Raj earlier, which ushered in the new India in 1991. Moreover, the progenitors of the 1991 reforms were a trio of self-effacing leaders: Prime Minister Narasimha Rao provided the political leadership; Finance Minister Manmohan Singh the intellectual and technocratic heft; and Principal Secretary Amar Nath Verma was the indispensable bureaucratic enforcer. How did this happen? In this essay, I attempt to provide some answers to this question by giving a detailed genesis of the industrial policy reform that formed the backbone of reforms of 1991. To quote Finance Minister Manmohan Singh’s 1991 budget speech (citing Victor Hugo): ‘No power on earth can stop an idea whose time has come.’
  But let me start with some of the questions that have typically engaged observers of the reforms:
* Who was more responsible for the 1991 reforms: Prime Minister Narasimha Rao or Finance Minister Manmohan Singh?
* Were these reforms home-grown or were they pushed down India’s throat by the IMF and the World Bank?
* How was it that such radical reforms could be undertaken at that time despite long-lasting resistance by the Indian political and bureaucratic elites for a very long time?
Until recently, the general view had given Finance Minister Manmohan Singh the pride of place as the key driver of reforms during the 1991–96 period. However, the revisionist view now gives greater prominence to the role of Narasimha Rao in actually getting the 1991 reforms politically accepted and implemented.2 It was clearly a partnership: Manmohan Singh certainly provided the intellectual leadership to the comprehensive nature of economic reforms carried out over that five-year period, while Narasimha Rao’s political sagacity, management skills and courage were essential to the reform project. It was perhaps his very lack of flamboyance and charisma that provided the necessary gravitas that made political acceptance feasible. And he clearly gave full, explicit political backing to Manmohan Singh to do what had to be done. The fact that, since the early 1970s, Manmohan Singh had held every conceivable leadership position in the Ministry of Finance, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Planning Commission—the highest organs of economic policymaking in the government—provided confidence in the measures that were taken.
  This was certainly an unlikely team to carry out the radical changes in economic policies that were implemented. Both of them were known much more as loyal deputies to the Congress leadership from Indira Gandhi’s time and neither was particularly known for decisive leadership. Both certainly rose to the occasion and delivered the country from a serious economic crisis and set it on a sustainable high-growth path that has lasted for twenty-five years so far, despite a number of changes in the government over this period. But it was the third member of the team who is seldom given credit for what transpired during that five-year period—Principal Secretary Amar Nath Verma—whose role was crucial to the implementation of economic reforms. Despite no previous familiarity between the two, it was providential that Narasimha Rao appointed him as his principal secretary: he clearly turned out to be the right man for the right job at the right time.
  As I relate below, it was Verma who was responsible for the initiation of industrial policy reforms much earlier as industry secretary, so he could usher in the radical reforms in no time once given the opportunity. Perhaps even more important, having gained success in implementing this radical reform, he acquired enough confidence to be the enforcer of the economic reforms regime over the next five years.
  Thus, it was this unlikely trio that should be given somewhat equal credit for what transpired in the economic policy realm between 1991 and 1996.
  I am not qualified to say much more on the first question, and I leave it to those who were nearer the political decision-making process at the top at that time to give a clear verdict.3 In his chapter in this volume, T.N. Ninan4 has provided an insightful political-economy framework, within which the economic reforms have been carried out (and constrained) in India.
  Could these reforms have been accomplished without the pressure of the IMF and the World Bank? Possibly not. There is nothing like a crisis to focus the political and bureaucratic mind. But then, there is no shortage of crises that different countries have suffered over the last half-century or so: in fact, more than 100 countries have suffered such crises and have been subjected to IMF programmes. If they had all succeeded in carrying out IMF-imposed programmes, the world would perhaps be a much better place now!
  After the excesses of the late 1980s, the dual balance-of-payments and fiscal crises had been building up in India for a couple of years before 1991, but action could not be taken because of the then ongoing political instability in the country. By the time the new government came to power on 21 June 1991 the economic situation was dire—inflation was well into double digits and foreign-exchange reserves had hit rock bottom; something just had to be done. In their contributions to this volume, C. Rangarajan5 and Montek Singh Ahluwalia provide vivid first-person accounts of the macroeconomic mess that the country found itself in 1991. The IMF and World Bank pressure was undeniable. However, resorting to an IMF programme in 1981–82 had not resulted in a similar well-organized reform programme. The balance-of-payment difficulties arising from the oil price increase in 1989–90 had necessitated the use of a loan of SDR 3.9 billion from the IMF’s ‘Extended Fund Facility’ at that time.
  This time it succeeded because, as I document, there was actually an emerging technocratic consensus on the direction of reforms over the previous decade or so. Moreover, the collapse of the Soviet Union in the previous year added to the Reagan–Thatcher ideological winds that had been blowing in the 1980s. The 1980s also saw developing countries launching economic reforms—the so-called wave of structural adjustment programmes. The East Asian miracle was grounded in more liberal industrial and trade regimes with an export focus. Dr Manmohan Singh has also talked of how his work for the South Commission raised his awareness of how East Asia was progressing relative to India. The world was changing around us, and we became aware that we were being left behind.
  A great deal of work had been done towards liberalization within different arms of the economic policy establishment during the 1980s. So, in some sense, the country was ready and a good part of the reform programme was indeed home-grown. Montek Ahluwalia has provided an overview of the overall reform programme in his chapter.6 My general conclusion is that the reforms were much more home-grown than often thought by observers.
  With this general background, I now focus on one aspect of the programme, the industrial policy reforms of 1991, as an illustration of the domestic generation of the overall reform process. These reforms were somewhat different in that they were comprehensive in the industry policy realm and were carried out in one shot on 24 July 1991, less than five weeks after the new government came into power. Most of the other reforms had to be done over a period of time: fiscal, trade, monetary and financial sector policy reforms were carried out gradually over the next decade or so.
My Personal Journey to the 1991 Industrial Policy Reforms
I first came back to India in 1980 to work as a ‘senior consultant’ on urban development in the Planning Commission, after having spent almost sixteen years abroad. It was Professor Raj Krishna, as a member of the Morarji Desai government’s Planning Commission, who, in 1979, had invited me to come to the commission in recognition of my work on housing and urban development with the World Bank. At that time, there was very little work in the country on urbanization and its attendant problems; hence, the interest in inviting me to the commission. By late 1980, when I was finally able to extricate myself from the large multiyear research project that I was involved in, ‘The City Study’ on Bogota and Cali, Colombia, and obtained leave from the World Bank, the government had changed and Professor Raj Krishna had returned to academia. In those days of a relatively depoliticized Planning Commission, my appointment was honoured but no one in the commission really knew why I had arrived when I did and what I was supposed to. Those were the days when people like me, returning to India from abroad, from institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, were viewed with suspicion. In fact, the welcome greeting I received from a senior member of the administration on the first day went something like this: ‘Why have you come here? Is there something wrong with you? Or is there some problem in your family? Why would you leave a cushy job in the World Bank to come here? You know that we don’t treat people like you well here!’7
  I survived all this and worked exclusively on housing and urban development for three years before returning to the World Bank after my leave ended. There was really very little interest shown in what I was doing except for Dr Manmohan Singh who was then the member secretary of the Planning Commission. To keep me busy, and perhaps to get me out of his hair, he agreed to appoint four task forces on housing and urban development, with me as the member secretary to each of them.
  This turned out to be a very rewarding experience for me, since the members of each of the task forces were senior civil servants engaged in housing and urban development issues, and other independent experts and academics from across the country. Each of the meetings of the task forces was held in different cities of the country, so I was also able to get familiarity with the working of state and city governments, as also some personal knowledge of our main cities. From my perch at the Planning Commission, I was able to get to know most of the senior economists in the country as well. As someone who lived abroad from the age of sixteen to thirty-two, this was indeed a great opportunity. The result was preparation of four comprehensive task-force reports on planning, financing and management of urban development, and on housing and shelter for the urban poor, which attempted to provide a blueprint for what was needed to anticipate the course of urbanization in the country for the following twenty years or so, and the approach that needed to be adopted. These reports did arouse a great deal of interest among the cognoscenti of urban development, but did not succeed in catching the attention of mainstream policymakers, and hence, were essentially buried in the archives of the Planning Commission. The one concrete result was the founding of the National Housing Bank, which was an indirect descendent of one of the recommendations of the Task Force on Financing of Urban Development, chaired by the redoubtable Raja Chelliah.8
  However, having achieved what I came out to do, I returned to the World Bank at the end of my three-year leave. I also concluded that the time was not ripe for policy work in urban development in India. There were too many moving parts in the system between the central, state and urban local governments and too few policy instruments at the central level to be effective and, in any case, too little interest. Consequently, I decided that I needed to retrain myself and work on more mainstream policy areas, such as industrial and trade policy, and on macroeconomic policy.
  After returning to the World Bank in late 1983, I spent a year finishing the earlier work on the City Study, which resulted in two full-fledged monographs on the ‘developing metropolis’. It was then time to move on and abandon urban development. I was fortunate to get appointed as a senior country economist in the World Bank’s Philippines division in early 1985. This was a momentous time for the Philippines when the transition took place from President Marcos to President Aquino, and the IMF and the World Bank got active in designing macro-stabilization and structural adjustment programmes for the country. Among other activities at the macro level I was designated to lead a large team to design industrial policy reforms. This was fortuitous as it gave me some idea of the policy process involved in designing countrywide macroeconomic strategy, including tax reforms, but particularly focused on industrial policy.
  Meanwhile, in India, after Indira Gandhi’s assassination, her successor Rajiv Gandhi appointed Dr Manmohan Singh as the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission. Just as I was completing the industrial strategy report for the Philippines in 1986, I got a call from him to return to India to join the Planning Commission as one of the three economic advisers in the newly formed development policy division in the commission. I readily agreed and returned to India at the end of 1986. This was a prescient attempt by the then deputy chairman Dr Manmohan Singh to begin the transformation of the Planning Commission towards a greater and active role in formulating policy. It is ironic that twenty-eight years after that largely failed initiative, the whole Planning Commission has now been transformed into the NITI Aayog, the ‘Policy Commission’!
  The development policy division never really took off, especially after Dr Manmohan Singh got appointed to the South Commission in Geneva and left in late 1987. But with members such as Abid Hussain, Yoginder Alagh and Raja Chelliah, and advisers such as old-timer Nitin Desai, newly appointed economic advisers, Arvind Virmani and Srinivas Madhur, and Jairam Ramesh9 for company, that commission was an intellectually absorbing place to be. Abid Hussain,10 in particular, as one of the early liberalizers, was constantly pushing the policy envelope and consistently on the lookout for new ideas. He encouraged each of us to contribute: Srinivas Madhur assisted him on a committee on capital markets; among other activities, he asked me to assist him as member secretary in a High-Level Committee (HLC) on Restructuring the Textile Industry, and later in a similar capacity in an HLC on Industrial Exports.11 Both these roles brought me into direct contact with industrial policy as it was at the time, and also brought me face-to-face with the powerful vested interests as they existed in trade unions, incumbent industrialists and in the entrenched bureaucracy. The work for the textile committee, which included a research project that I commissioned Omkar Goswami (one of the contributors to this volume) to do, brought home to me in very vivid form how irrational and dysfunctional our industrial control system was. In the garb of protecting employment, it had essentially succeeded in almost destroying an industry that was once India’s pride. To give but one example: a weaving mill was not allowed to replace an ageing loom without specific permission from the textile commissioner, in the interest of protecting employment in handlooms. Thus, little investment took place and much of the textile industry in India was either aged or deceased by the late 1980s. India lost its place in the global textile industry, ceding its place to East and South East Asian countries and lately to Bangladesh.
  With this experience whetting my appetite for more active policy work, and the development policy division in the Planning Commission becoming increasingly moribund, I was on the lookout for a more regular mainstream economic adviser appointment. I was also keen to avoid returning to the arid confines of the World Bank in Washington. I was pipped to the post of economic adviser in the Ministry of Commerce by my friend Jayanta Roy,12 but then came the providential opportunity to become economic adviser in the Ministry of Industry in late 1988. I jumped at it as I felt qualified enough to do this after the experience I had had in charting industrial strategy for the Philippines and my industry-related work in the Planning Commission. Moreover, although the Philippines itself was seen as the sick man of Asia, I had become fascinated by the unfolding East Asian miracle and had taken pains to familiarize myself with the successful macro, industrial and trade policies of the East Asian tigers.
  This turned out to be another challenge as the ministry had not had an effective economic adviser for some years, so his role had become restricted to compilation of the weekly wholesale price index and routine analysis of the index of industrial production, and hence far removed from policy issues. I therefore busied myself by doing research on the extant industrial policy and how it had evolved since Independence. India had been known to have among the most complex and comprehensive command-and-control economic systems, which was known pejoratively as the Licence Permit Raj. The result of my labours was a comprehensive paper co-authored with my colleague Vandana Aggarwal, who was then a young senior research officer from the Indian Economic Service.13 This turned out to be fortuitous as it provided a pretty comprehensive understanding of the origins of the Indian economic control system as it operated at the time, and enabled me to insert myself in the ministry’s policymaking process when the opportunity came later. I also learnt a great deal about how the control system really worked by participating in the myriad of committees that an entrepreneur had to negotiate before he would actually invest in a new industrial project.
  From my personal viewpoint, this was the beginning of the process of what later culminated in the 1991 industrial policy reforms.
  Given the transformational changes that have taken place since then, it is useful to relate what I found: how the system actually operated even as late as the late 1980s, and how desperate the need for reforms were.
A Detour: Contours of the Licence Permit Raj
Prior to the sweeping industrial policy reforms of 1991, the establishment and operation of an industrial enterprise in India required approval from the central government at almost every step.14 Before making an investment, an entrepreneur had to obtain an ‘in principle’ approval from the Ministry of Industry. The granting of this approval resulted in the issuance of a ‘Letter of Intent’ (LoI), which usually included a requirement for a phased manufacturing programme (PMP) aimed at progressive indigenization of the manufacturing process. Armed with this LoI, the entrepreneur could then tie up other requirements for setting up the project. If he needed to import capital goods, he had to obtain a capital goods import licence from the Chief Controller of Imports and Exports (CCI&E), in the Ministry of Commerce. The approval for the import, however, was given by a committee set up in the Ministry of Industry. If there was also a need for a foreign-collaboration agreement, as there usually was, the entrepreneur had to obtain a specific approval for this, an ‘FC’ approval, from a committee chaired by the finance secretary, but serviced by the Ministry of Industry, which then enabled the allocation of foreign exchange from the RBI. In order to raise funds for the project, if an entrepreneur wanted to go to the capital market, he needed separate approval from the Controller of Capital Issues (CCI) in the Ministry of Finance. For import of raw material and components, separate licences had to be obtained on an annual basis from the CCI&E, with the list each year having been determined by the requirements of the PMP. In each case, an essentiality and indigenous non-availability clearance had to be given by the technical wing of the Ministry of Industry, the Directorate General of Technical Development (DGTD). Once everything was tied up and the unit was about to go into production, the entrepreneur had to go back to the Ministry of Industry for an Industrial Licence, and then approach the government-owned development finance institutions for funding. In this whole approval process, the DGTD was the linchpin as it alone was supposed to possess the technical knowledge needed to process the approvals at this stage.
  In their respective chapters in this volume, Baba Kalyani and Narayana Murthy provide a flavour of the command-and-control raj in their evocative personal accounts of what they went through to set up their businesses in the 1980s. The incredible expansion that Bharat Forge and Infosys demonstrated in the 1990s and 2000s, along with international competitiveness, once they were liberated, give some idea of the power of earlier constraints.
  As it happens, it is important to understand that each of these controls was inherited from the Second World War when the Defence of India Act was promulgated in 1939. Comprehensive economic controls were put in motion through issuance of Rules 81 and 84 of the Defence of India Rules.15 Rule 81 had a blanket provision for ‘regulating or prohibiting the production, treatment, keeping storage, employment, transport, distribution, disposable, acquisition, use or consumption of articles or things of any description whatsoever’; under Rule 84, the central government was also empowered to prohibit or restrict import or export of all kinds and to control the purchase of foreign exchange and to make restrictions on payments, etc. These powers were later enshrined in a flurry of specific legislative enactments soon after Independence in 1947: the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA); the Imports and Exports (Controls) Act; the Capital Issues (Continuance of Controls) Act; and a little later in 1951, the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act (IDR Act). These main instruments of economic administration were extensions of the Defence of India powers acquired by the government during the Second World War. They essentially served as the administrative instruments designed to implement the thinking on industrial policy as had been expressed in the Statement of Industrial Policy (1945), the Industrial Policy Resolution (1948), and later, the 1956 Industrial Policy Resolution. This panoply of controls has usually been seen to result from the practice of planning in India. It is important to understand that, first, the economic and industrial control system was actually put in place before planning started in 1952; and second, that the system originated in the war powers of 1939. Given these origins, the system was much more for control and less for development. This was also consistent with the colonial bureaucratic mindset more designed to control rather than foster development: a system that we inherited and have not changed to this date.
  As if this old set of controls was not enough, new forms of control were added over the years. There had traditionally been great concern in India with the concentration of economic power. As a result, the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act (MRTP) was promulgated in 1969. Under the provisions of this Act, companies with assets over a specified limit16 had to obtain separate clearance from the MRTP Commission. Moreover, such companies could invest in only a specified set of industries; foreign direct investment (FDI) was also permitted (up to a limit of 40 per cent equity) in the same list of industries.17 Further, the promotion of small-scale industries had been an objective of Indian planning from the beginning. It was assumed that most consumer goods were produced with low technology, which was labour-using and exhibited constant returns to scale. Hence, manufacturing employment would be promoted by confining the production of such items to small-scale enterprises, thereby disallowing their production in large manufacturing units. The list of such items was expanded significantly during the Morarji Desai-led Janata Party government during 1977–80, when the Left-leaning George Fernandes was the industry minister. By 1990, as many as 836 items of production were reserved for production in small-scale enterprises.18 Almost all consumer goods items that led the East Asian manufacturing push in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, such as clothing of all kinds, shoes, toys, hand tools, dinnerware, cutlery and stationery, were included in this list.
  Indian manufacturing was thus rendered uncompetitive in world markets and, ironically, manufacturing employment growth was severely stunted in the bargain. By the mid-1990s, while India had fewer than 10 million organized manufacturing-sector workers, China had more than a hundred million. There was an additional list of industries reserved for exclusive production in the public sector. A prospective investor had to make sure that he did not intend to produce an item included in any of these lists. From 1977, there was also a ban on the location of industries in the twenty to thirty largest cities. In 1988, this ban was extended to include municipal areas of all towns and cities and to specific areas of influence around the twenty-one largest cities. This was among the most irrational policies adopted, bordering on the bizarre; ever since the industrial revolution, industrialization and urbanization have gone hand in hand. By prohibiting the location of industries in urban areas, they were deprived of the productivity gains that arise from agglomeration economies, and towns and cities were deprived of the energy and entrepreneurship that industries bring with them.
  Such a system of detailed physical controls can be interpreted as the private-sector arm of the command economy. If the desire is to run a command system in the private sector, the natural inclination of a bureaucracy is to use quantitative and physical controls. The instruments of an indicative fiscal system are too indirect for administrators whose general training is for control. To turn an old saying on its head, you can stop a horse from drinking water but you cannot bring him to it!
  In the presence of such a Byzantine system of industrial and trade controls, it is a miracle that Indian industry grew at all over the long period of forty years since 1950. In fact, Indian industrial growth averaged around 6 per cent per annum over the 1950–90 period as a whole, and over 7.5 per cent from 1950 to 1965 and during the 1980s. In the beginning, when the primary aim of planning was to push up the extremely low levels of savings and investment rates, and when brand-new investments into new areas were being planned in the public sector, the command mode of planning proved to be quite successful in helping to achieve a high growth rate in industry and in the economy as a whole. This very system found it difficult to adapt to the changing circumstances and to the series of serious exogenous shocks that the economy was subject to between 1965 and 1975. The failure of Indian planning and economic policy was that it did not adapt to changing circumstances as the country grew, and the industrial economy became more complex, and as the international environment changed from the relatively stable period of the 1950s and early 1960s to an environment that was characterized by rapid change on a regular basis. The higher industrial growth of the 1980s was brought with fiscal excesses financing higher public-sector investments, along with the beginning of hesitant liberalization of the control system.
  In retrospect, it is very difficult to understand why such a system persisted over this long period, particularly when the rest of the world had moved on, especially in East and South East Asia with spectacular results. Remarkably, and what is ironic is that, even by the early 1960s, it was well understood that this system was ill-suited to directing investments. Accordingly, in the 1960s, the government appointed one committee after another to examine the industrial licensing system (see Government of India 1964a, 1964b, 1965, 1967, 1969a, 1969b).19 According to H.K. Paranjape, a member of the Industrial Licensing Policy Inquiry Committee of 1969, the committee had firmly concluded that the system had failed practically on all counts, whether it was regional dispersal, import substitution, preventing concentration of economic power, enforcement of licensing conditions, or even implementation of planning priorities.20
  Even with such damning indictments, it is instructive to examine what such committees actually recommended. They would typically conclude that, despite its defects, the industrial licensing system was useful and should continue. Although they recognized that since preparing detailed perspective plans for all industries was neither necessary nor practicable, and industrial licensing should be confined to industries in the basic, strategic and critical sectors, no significant change took place in the industrial regulation system until the 1980s.21 Instead, what the Industrial Licensing Policy Inquiry Committee of 1969, for example, actually recommended were:
* There should be a list of reservations for small-scale industry production.
* Bans on further capacity creation should be utilized to prevent the creation of ‘undesirable industries’, particularly the production of non-essential luxury goods.
This committee recommended a host of other measures that would require more, not less, detailed quantitative direction. The findings of these committees illustrate the kind of thinking that dominated the Indian industrial regulatory environment. There was always a persistent reluctance to learn from past experience and to change course. The disjunction between plan aspirations and the war-derived control instruments persisted. It would be easy to ascribe this impermeability of the system to vested interests, rent-seeking, etc. Bureaucrats gain due to the vast discretionary powers such a system grants them, in addition to the opportunities for corruption. Politicians gain in a similar manner. Bigger industrialists gain because of the advantages of preferential access they enjoy. Such a system always favours incumbents while discriminating against those who are not. Entry is made expensive in more ways than one. Perhaps it was the structure of the Indian administrative service that explains this persistence. The top levels of Indian ministries are staffed by generalists who have spent most of their time as administrative officers in Indian states. Apart from exceptions, they are usually talented generalists who have little domain knowledge. Their prior training is really on exercising control in an administrative fashion. So, what comes naturally to them is control rather than informed development. It was therefore not surprising that this ‘command-and-control’ system existed for such a long time. What is more difficult to comprehend is the continued allegiance of the majority of informed academic opinion to this system.
  It was only in the 1980s that deregulation gained some support; ironically, there was more support for deregulation in the bureaucracy than in academe. It is difficult to find scholarly articles from Indian economists arguing for industrial deregulation during that period. The majority of academic opinion still believed that this control system supported the ideals of planned development.
  The complexity of the system itself challenged the comprehension of most observers despite a comprehensive description of the system in all these government reports. Interestingly, there was also little academic pressure for deregulation, apart from the seminal work of Jagdish Bhagwati and Padma Desai,22 which came as early as 1970. A further exhaustive update was provided by the 1979 Dagli Committee report commissioned under the Morarji Desai government.23 Again, there was no action taken; perhaps the interlinkages within the control system were such that it was difficult to implement incremental change and the framework and mechanisms available in the government militated against systematic change. There were also considerable risks attached, which made it difficult for anyone to take responsibility for radical changes. As a result, the fig leaf of planned development through licensing and controls remained for a long time. That the emperor had no clothes was too painful for the system to acknowledge.
The Impetus for Industrial Policy Reforms
Such was the situation at the beginning of the 1980s when Indira Gandhi returned to power as prime minister. Stagnation in industrial growth since the mid-1960s had started becoming obvious,24 so political perception of the need to act gathered some force. She laid the groundwork for tentative economic policy reforms towards deregulation by appointing a succession of committees headed by noted technocrat civil servants, L.K. Jha,25 M. Narasimham,26 Abid Hussain27 and Arjun Sengupta,28 on overall deregulation, trade reform and public enterprise reform respectively. The reports of these committees were in the direction of some liberalization, however tentative. Similarly, the Bureau of Industrial Costs and Prices, which had hitherto acted as the czar of administered industrial prices ranging from steel to cement, copper to pharmaceuticals, and all manner of other industrial intermediate inputs, began to change track in the 1980s under the successive leadership of another set of modernizing civil servant technocrats: Lovraj Kumar, Yoginder Alagh and Vijay Kelkar.29 A succession of reports on steel, cement, aluminium, etc. ensued, each of which recommended some price deregulation. The success of East Asian economies had perhaps made the government more receptive to these recommendations Thus, as Rajiv Gandhi came into power after his mother’s assassination in late 1984, the environment for trade and industrial deregulation became more positive, but still resulted in rather half-hearted measures, which Arvind Panagariya has characterized as ‘liberalization by stealth’.30 Nonetheless, positive results were seen with industrial growth recovering from its previous stagnation.
Back to My Story
It was towards the end of this period that I came to the Ministry of Industry as economic adviser in December 1988, full of enthusiasm to work on further industrial policy reforms. By this time, however, the reformist steam in Rajiv Gandhi’s government was beginning to peter out in the aftermath of the political maelstrom caused by the Bofors scandal unfolding over the next few months. So, there really was not much to do in the ministry and, as mentioned earlier, I busied myself with research and sponsorship of research projects. But then came T.N. Seshan, as Cabinet secretary, who started a flurry of activity in the government as a whole. He, of course, later achieved great fame as a very effective chief election commissioner from 1990 to 1996. Seshan was seen by many as a control freak who saw himself as a no-nonsense leader who needed to know everything going on in the government. The post of Cabinet secretary was perhaps too inactive for him, so he asked all the major departments to prepare detailed presentations on what they did and where they were proposing to go. The bureaucracy, of course, saw this as a time-wasting, fruitless exercise that the joint and additional secretaries were loath to do. Such thankless tasks were generally placed in the laps of economic advisers so that the others could continue with their licence-permit activities!
  Thus, I was confronted with the task of preparing the ministry’s presentation before Seshan. The question I had to answer, in principle, was fairly simple: what is India’s industrial policy? It turned out that this was actually quite a complex task in light of the description I have already given of the many different components of what comprised industrial policy at the time. The complexity had actually increased as a consequence of the piecemeal reforms of the previous few years that I have alluded to, and which the ministry was very proud of. The very process of compiling and collating all the existing industrial licensing policies, and lists of industries subject to different provisions, involved interaction with all parts of the ministry so that an accurate rendition could be given to the fearsome Seshan. This, ironically, was perhaps the first step that then led to the industrial policy reforms of 1991. Personally, it gave me an opportunity to document and become familiar with all aspects of industrial licensing and control policies, and also to establish relationships with all parts of the ministry. The resulting presentation was perhaps the first time that the many different licensing and control mechanisms that existed could be seen in one place, giving rise to the possibility of designing a package of comprehensive industrial policy reforms. However, although the exercise was thus very instructive, not much came of it as the Rajiv Gandhi ministry started unravelling towards the end of 1989—new elections were called for, the Congress party lost power, as did Seshan in the process.
  When the V.P. Singh government came to power in early December 1989, the new non-Congress government wanted to differentiate itself from the Congress history of Licence Permit Raj. Moreover, during his time as finance minister in Rajiv Gandhi’s government, Singh had acquired a reputation for being a liberal reformer in the context of those days. And so, when V.P. Singh became the prime minister, there was a renewed expectation that economic reforms would be undertaken towards liberalization of the economy.
  Ajit Singh was appointed the new industry minister. Though relatively unknown at the time, he was the son of former prime minister Charan Singh, the most prominent farmer leader of India. He was also a breath of fresh air. While today, his reputation has been sullied for repeatedly and opportunistically changing parties and coalitions, he was then seen as a smart ‘techie’. His IIT education followed with further specialization in computer science at the Illinois Institute of Technology, and experience working within the American corporate culture of IBM, had made him impatient and instinctively critical of the industrial Licence Permit Raj of the time. With the new government came a reshuffle of secretaries. Amar Nath Verma, the commerce secretary at the time, succeeded Otima Bordia as industry secretary. Verma had spent a number of years in the UN ESCAP (Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific) secretariat in Bangkok. Therefore, he had also become familiar with the East Asian economic miracle. He was very open and reform-minded, as evidenced by his inclination to empower his imported economic advisers wherever he was! In the commerce ministry, he had made extensive use of my friend Jayanta Roy. I was therefore able to establish a great rapport with him as soon as he came.
  Whenever a new minister comes, the civil servants make a presentation describing the ministry and its work content. With Verma being new, this new thankless task again fell on me. So, what did I do? In no time, I dug out the presentation prepared earlier for Seshan, impressing Verma no end! He could brief Ajit Singh very quickly and in detail.
  Living up to his image of a technocratic modern man, Ajit Singh’s reaction was one of shock, something to the effect of ‘What is all this nonsense? How can we function this way?’ And we were tasked to prepare an agenda for industrial reforms.
  The lightning rod was the annual World Economic Forum summit at Davos, held in late January 1990, where developing countries eager to attract global attention and capital displayed their wares to the assembled collectivity of ‘Davos Man’. V.P. Singh was keen to promote a reformist image of India and nominated Ajit Singh to lead the Indian contingent. This in itself was significant since any action attracting foreign direct investment to India would be a departure from previous policy.
  Once again, a presentation had to be prepared, this time for the minister, including a pitch for liberalization of FDI. I had already had the opportunity to see the whole picture on control mechanisms that were in place, including industrial licensing, phased manufacturing programmes, monopolies regulation, control of capital issues, export–import controls and foreign-technology control. Having got the opportunity, I now went further in proposing changes that could possibly pass muster with the powers that be and which could be put forward in an elite international setting. With only a few weeks to go before the end January Davos meeting, those were busy weeks, with frequent meetings between the minister, the secretary and me as he prepared for the trip. We were encouraged by Ajit Singh’s positive receptivity. Since none of us had known each other earlier, it also meant an intense effort to understand each other’s views in the short period. This was then the second stage of preparation of what later became the industrial policy reforms of 1991.
  Unfortunately, however, this effort also came to naught since, at the last minute, Prime Minister V.P. Singh ditched Ajit Singh and inexplicably nominated Arif Mohammad Khan, the minister for civil aviation and energy, to go in his stead. The powerful official delegation—comprising A.N. Verma, Montek Singh Ahluwalia, secretary in the prime minister’s office (PMO), and Nitin Desai, the finance ministry’s chief economic adviser, and with me carrying the bags, had already left Delhi, and it was only when we arrived in Zürich that we learnt of the ministerial switch. Since Arif had no background on industrial or economic policy issues and there had been no time for a briefing, there could be no productive presentation in the meeting. So, the trip ended up being a fiasco. For me personally, however, it was an extremely enriching experience being exposed to the global business and policymaking elite in a concentrated course of four days, and also becoming familiar with the titans of Indian business who comprised the Indian business delegation. This came to be extremely helpful over the next two decades during my policymaking period in India, as they became personal friends and very useful interlocutors for understanding business viewpoints over the following couple of decades. In fact, some of them are contributors to this volume: Tarun Das, in his chapter on government–industry interaction, has talked about the value of consistent government–industry relations fostered in an environment of mutual trust.
  This experience, however, did not deter Ajit Singh from continuing the work to prepare a new industrial reform blueprint. Under the continued leadership of A.N. Verma, then ensued a very intense period of due diligence and research as we prepared a detailed comprehensive framework for what could constitute a very significant departure for Indian industrial policy after a period of almost four decades. This was indeed an opportunity of a lifetime, which I felt fortunate to get. A.N. Verma was a demanding taskmaster who wanted to cover all possibilities before putting forward any proposals to the government. We did a mountain of quantitative research on all the different aspects of industrial policy so that we could answer most questions that may be expected to arise. Much of this work fell on my office—the Office of the Economic Adviser. The enthusiasm and hard work of my small staff of half a dozen Indian economic service officials had to be seen to be believed.
  For his part, Ajit Singh kept a busy schedule of public meetings and speeches to gauge the reaction of the country’s businessmen on possible radical approaches to industrial policy. He also held meetings with economists and businessmen to solicit suggestions. The task of ministerial speeches usually falls on the lot of the economic adviser, since this is also seen to be a thankless one. With Minister Ajit Singh’s encouragement, I used this opportunity to keep pushing the envelope for possible industrial policy reforms as a sounding board for testing public reactions to propose changes. Given the long record of controls, I found that expectations from the private sector in terms of reforms were indeed very modest. They simply could not imagine the possibility of implementation of wide-ranging policy reforms.
  Much of the difficulty that arose in pushing reform was really within the government. The Cabinet consisted of a motley group of leaders from different parties, with different backgrounds and ideologies, assembled in an unwieldy coalition. Finance Minister Madhu Dandavate was an old socialist and his senior staff consisted of Bimal Jalan31 as finance secretary and Nitin Desai as the chief economic adviser.32 As we sought the prime minister’s in-principle approval to go ahead with a liberalizing industrial policy, he asked Ajit Singh to forge a consensus with the other main economic ministries, particularly the finance ministry. This we failed to do, since Dandavate, backed by his advisers, was not in favour, and nor were some other members in the government, including some in the Planning Commission. In a stormy meeting of the two ministers, backed up by their respective senior officials, we did not succeed in reaching a consensus on the kind of reforms that we wanted.
  We barrelled on regardless, and all our hard work eventually resulted in something concrete, though much diluted: the New Industrial Policy of 1990. This document was a relatively comprehensive policy statement, clumsily titled ‘Policy measures for the Promotion of Small-Scale and Agro-based Industries and Changes in Procedures for Industrial Approvals’. Reflecting the many different views in the government, the new directions in the policy were effectively camouflaged under the rubric of even greater protection being given to small industries! This long-forgotten policy33 had made it past the Cabinet and was formally announced by Ajit Singh in Parliament on 31 May 1990, and the document was laid on the table of the House. This can be seen as the third stage in the preparation of the 1991 industrial policy reforms.
  The policy addressed issues ranging from the promotion of small and medium enterprises, removal of ‘unnecessary bureaucratic shackles’ and easing raw-material import restrictions to delicensing, deregulation and welcoming foreign investment. Among other ideas, it proposed that various licensing requirements be withdrawn for certain sets of priority industries. Similarly, it proposed a major departure in liberalizing FDI, once again in a specified list of industries. The major drawback of the document was a lack of clarity over these lists. The policy announcement had just mentioned, in principle, that there would be these lists of industries to be notified later; but these lists were yet to be prepared.
  There was then a comical bureaucratic interlude, which effectively buried the policy even before it got into political difficulties. As part of the modernization effort embedded in the policy announcement, I had attempted to make these industry lists in the new globally accepted harmonized system of international trade classification (ITC-HS), a departure from the antiquated classification system used in the original 1951 IDR Act. As we laboured to make these lists in the new classification, we prepared documents to be taken to the committee of secretaries, then headed by Seshan’s successor, V.C. Pande, for approval. As luck would have it, the first entry in the ITC-HS classification34 happens to be: 0101 Live Horses, Asses, Mules and Hinnies-Horses.
  As the document was opened in the meeting, Pande’s eyes fell on this unfortunate line and he exploded, exclaiming (in Hindi), ‘Have we assembled here to discuss horses, asses and mules?’ The mirth that then ensued among the assembled group of dour-faced secretaries of the economic ministries sitting in the rarefied confines of the Cabinet room can only be imagined. The curmudgeonly V.C. Pande led the charge, and I was unceremoniously hustled out of the room to my great and lasting embarrassment. Thus ended the life of the stillborn 1990 Industrial Policy Statement! This was fortunate since the eventual 1991 policy statement was far more comprehensive and radical.
  In any case, a number of political forces, starting with Chandra Shekhar’s rebellion (ostensibly) over the industrial policy, Deputy Prime Minister and Agriculture Minister Devi Lal’s farmer agitation, and the BJP’s Rath Yatra as a counter to the Mandal Commission, combined to bring down the V.P. Singh government on 10 November 1990. Consequently, Chandra Shekhar finally realized his dream to become the prime minister, with outside support from the Congress.
  As one of the leading faces behind the opposition to industrial reforms, Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar chose to retain the industry portfolio: a first in Indian government history. As industry minister, he then visited Udyog Bhawan, the headquarters of the industry ministry, where he addressed the assembled senior bureaucrats in that ministry. He told us, ‘I have just come to see you. I have become industry minister because I had disagreed with what you had done. However, I want you to know that I want you to keep giving me your best, impartial advice of whatever you think is correct. Don’t worry about what I said in the past few months!’
  As the new government came in, there was another reshuffle of secretaries and A.N. Verma got shifted to the Planning Commission as the member secretary and was succeeded by his close friend and colleague Suresh Mathur, who was another liberal-minded bureaucrat. After Chandra Shekhar’s visit, I asked whether we should take his words at face value and continue working on the New Industrial Policy. He said, ‘Why not? You keep trucking on. And we will see what happens.’ So we continued the process of refinement of the policy document as it existed then.
  The economic crisis was already gathering force by then. Save for firefighting on the economic and political fronts, the government was paralysed. There was certainly no question of initiating any significant policy reforms in any sphere. Within a few months, by mid-March 1991, Chandra Shekhar’s rump administration collapsed without even facing a parliamentary test, but it continued as a caretaker government while elections were called. In view of the political confusion and instability experienced over the previous year and a half, there was general expectation that the Rajiv Gandhi-led Congress party would come back to power. It was rumoured that his secretariat, which included Jairam Ramesh, was working on radical economic policy reforms to be set in motion once he came to power. His tragic assassination, however, extinguished all those expectations.
The 1991 Industrial Policy Reforms
In the event, a new Congress government did get elected and P.V. Narasimha Rao became the prime minister. He retained many of the faces of the outgoing regime. Perhaps of most consequence was the decision to select Amar Nath Verma as his principal secretary. This made Verma the prime minister’s personal enforcer and the most powerful bureaucrat, along with Cabinet Secretary Naresh Chandra.
  Narasimha Rao, like Chandra Shekhar, chose to retain the industry portfolio. Whether it was out of personal inclination or because he simply followed the portfolio allocation of his predecessor is a contested fact. Perhaps the new principal secretary, Verma, influenced Rao. In any case, that one of the authors of the 1990 New Industrial Policy landed in the PMO and that the prime minister chose to retain the industry portfolio turned out to be a fortunate coincidence. Along with Verma, he also chose to induct Jairam Ramesh in the PMO. This was perhaps a signal that he wanted to pursue a liberalization agenda and implement what had been in Rajiv Gandhi’s mind. Furthermore, in view of the grave economic crisis, he appointed Dr Manmohan Singh as the finance minister.
  Within a few days of his appointment, Manmohan Singh called a meeting of all the secretaries of the major economic ministries and the chief economic adviser. I was the only non-secretary present, as the new industry secretary, Suresh Mathur, took me along with him. Manmohan Singh outlined the full economic reform programme that was to be followed over the next five years—and more importantly, over the next six weeks. The latter included immediate action to be taken on industry policy. He said quite clearly that he had the full mandate of the prime minister to do whatever had to be done to solve the crisis and to put India on a self-sustained medium- and long-term growth path. Since he knew that some of the mandarins present were not on board with the kind of liberalizing economic reforms envisaged, he added, ‘If any of you have any difficulty with the proposed reform programme, we can find other things for you to do!’ This was perhaps the most firm and forceful that I ever saw Dr Manmohan Singh.
  Manmohan Singh knew that a framework on industrial policy reforms had already been prepared. With the looming economic crisis, Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar had appointed him as his economic adviser (with Cabinet rank) when he returned from Geneva in late 1990. It was during that period, as he was grappling with all the measures that needed to be taken to ward off the dual fiscal and balance-of-payments crises, that Dr Singh called me to say that he had heard that we had prepared an industrial policy document and, if so, could he see it? So, I trotted off to the Cabinet secretariat with alacrity the next day, where his office was (those were the days of hard copy and no Internet). Therefore, he knew that all the groundwork had already been done and he could be confident that they could deliver a credible document within a period of a few weeks.
  After the ‘horses, asses and mules’ fiasco of June 1990, and as the emerging instability in the political situation gathered force, with Suresh Mathur’s concurrence, we had continued our work in the industry ministry economic adviser’s office to refine the 1990 policy document. We had filled in the blanks with respect to the missing lists and had also purged it of the camouflaging parts related to protection of small-scale industry. This was the refurbished draft document that I handed over to Dr Singh in December 1990.
  With the finance minister having given a clear direction, a steering committee for economic reforms was created in the PMO under Principal Secretary A.N. Verma. The committee, consisting of the secretaries of the major economic ministries, particularly from finance and commerce, along with us from the industry ministry, met almost every day over the next six weeks. The draft policy document served as the basis for discussion and was refined almost daily. It was fortuitous of course that A.N. Verma knew every detail of the document and could hence shepherd the discussion very forcefully and efficiently. The main difficulties ironically came from the finance ministry officials, S.P. Shukla35 as the finance secretary and Deepak Nayyar36 as the chief economic adviser, who were holdovers from Chandra Shekhar’s government. They had honest and principled differences in views and did not hesitate to express them.37 The discussions were helped greatly by the strong support of Jairam Ramesh and Montek Ahluwalia,38 then commerce secretary, in the meetings.
  As a consequence of these daily meetings, we in the industry ministry had to redraft the policy every night, burning the midnight oil. In those days, few people in the government knew how to use a word processor efficiently. My personal assistant, Ajay Gupta, was one of them, and he used to churn out draft copies, in WordStar, on stencils, to be duplicated and distributed to other ministries every night!
  As the document emerged from the steering committee discussions, it then had to go to a newly formed Cabinet committee, which also met quite frequently in order to meet the six-week deadline.
  It was decided that the industrial policy would be presented along with the budget on 24 July 1991. A Cabinet note was prepared by my office in the industry ministry, which had to be approved by the new Cabinet on 19 July. Meanwhile, a note prepared for the prime minister by Jairam Ramesh on the radical new policy measures was leaked and published in the Hindustan Times on 12 July. The cat was out of the bag, and the reaction in the Cabinet meeting was predictable.
  However innocuous those reforms might seem today, they were revolutionary in 1991. Years of ideological baggage was being shed. Years of rhetoric was effectively being disowned. It seemed to some that Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi were being repudiated.
  The note did not pass the Cabinet. Instead, a group of ministers was set up to look into the policy proposals again, and it met on the evening of 20 July to discuss an amended, toned-down Cabinet note. But it did little to assuage the other side. Much of the opposition came from the old-guard, Gandhi family loyalists such as M.L. Fotedar39 and Arjun Singh.40 From the liberalization of industrial location policies and the relaxation of MRTP controls to ‘anti-PSU’ measures and openness to FDI, every proposal under the policy came under attack. The meeting broke up without a final decision. To assuage Arjun Singh, I was sent to lobby him along with my colleague from the industry ministry, Additional Secretary N.R. Krishnan, who had worked very closely with Arjun Singh as his special assistant when he was the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh. But this was to no avail. We failed miserably!
  It was felt that the ‘political packaging’ of the reforms was not right. Instead of tinkering with the policy proposals again, a long preamble to the Cabinet note was then prepared. Authored by the deft hands of wordsmiths Jairam Ramesh and Commerce Minister P. Chidambaram,41 in consultation with Manmohan Singh, it stressed continuity and change in the proposed policy reforms. It stressed that all interests were being taken care of, and mentioned the successive contributions of Prime Ministers Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi to industrial policy over the years, and how this document was in the same proud tradition. Not a word was changed in the substantive part of the document that had failed to pass muster earlier!42
  The new preamble did the trick and the Cabinet gave its seal of approval to the industrial reforms on 23 July. The Congress Working Committee (CWC) followed suit later that afternoon.
  Having learnt the ‘Horses, asses and mules’ lesson, this time, I had retreated to the original antiquated classification of industries in the different lists embodied in the policy document. These lists were notified later in the ITC HS classification. The only discussion that took place late at night with Naresh Chandra,43 the Cabinet secretary, was whether the industry lists appended to the policy statement should be called ‘Annexes’ or ‘Annexures’. I insisted that the world ‘annexure’ did not exist in any dictionary that I had come across, even though it was in common usage in Indian official documents. So, various dictionaries were consulted in the middle of the night and I had my little victory: among other innovations in this path-breaking New Industrial Policy was the use of the term ‘Annex’ rather than ‘Annexure’.
  The next day, at 12.50 p.m. on 24 July 1991, quite unceremoniously, a reluctant P.J. Kurien,44 the minister of state for industry, stood up in the Lok Sabha and tabled the New Industrial Policy, ushering in a new India, along with Finance Minister Manmohan Singh’s path-breaking Budget speech later in the day at 5 p.m.45
  The New Industrial Policy consisted of announcements related to:
A. Industrial Licensing was abolished for all industries, except for a specified list (Annex II in the document), irrespective of levels of investment. Some industries were to continue to be subject to compulsory licensing, ostensibly ‘for reasons related to security and strategic concerns, social reasons, problems related to safety and overriding environmental issues, manufacture of products of hazardous nature and articles of elitist consumption’. All other existing lists were to be abolished. Phased manufacturing programmes were no longer to be imposed and the previous stringent location restrictions were also abolished, except in cities with population of over 1 million.46
B. Foreign Investment: ‘In order to invite foreign investment in high-priority industries, requiring large investments and advanced technology’, it was decided to provide approval for direct foreign investment up to 51 per cent foreign equity in a specified list of industries, which hitherto had been known as the ‘Appendix I Industries’ and were areas in which FERA and MRTP companies had already been allowed to invest on a discretionary basis. This list was appended as Annex III. It was hoped that this framework would make it attractive for companies abroad to invest in India. It was expected that ‘foreign investment would bring attendant advantages of technology transfer, marketing expertise, introduction of modern managerial techniques and new possibilities for promotion of exports. This is particularly necessary in the changing global scenario of industrial and economic cooperation marked by mobility of capital. The government will therefore welcome foreign investment, which is in the interest of the country’s industrial development.’ This was a major departure from previous thinking and practice, where foreign investment was at best tolerated, a far cry from now being welcomed.
C. Foreign Technology Agreements: Contrary to the previous practice of the need to obtain specific approvals for every technology agreement, there would now be automatic approvals for foreign technology agreements within specified parameters. Indian companies would be free to negotiate the terms of technology transfer with their foreign counterparts, according to their own commercial judgements.
D. Public-sector Policy: Eighteen industries were reserved earlier for investment by public-sector enterprises only. This list was pruned down to a list of only eight industries (listed as Annex I of the document), which essentially covered only minerals, atomic energy, defence equipment and railways. The government therefore moved away from the ‘commanding heights’ philosophy of the 1950s. The policy also paved the way for disinvestment in public-sector companies through the public floatation of shares. It was also stated that private investment would be allowed in these areas selectively, and that this list would be kept under review. An intention was also expressed that action would be taken on sick public-sector enterprises so that they could be closed down after due process. To enable this, a social security mechanism would be created to protect the interests of workers likely to be affected by such rehabilitation packages. This is one aspect of the reform that remains to be implemented even today.47
E. MRTP Act: In another major departure from extant policy, the concept of ‘MRTP’ companies was abolished.48 The MRTP Act was to be amended significantly so that it would only deal with competition issues and restrictive trade practices.
Follow-up to the Industrial Policy Statement
What we hoped was that this policy would let loose animal spirits in the country as never before: delicensing would set in motion new domestic competition; foreign investors would find new opportunities for investment; entrepreneurs’ enhanced access to foreign technology would upgrade Indian industrial technology; and large companies would become free to become larger and also invest in areas where they could not earlier, including those that were earlier restricted to public-sector companies only. In short, we hoped that the Indian private sector would finally be unleashed and that India could now exhibit the kind of energy that had been demonstrated by the rest of Asia.
  This initial policy action was, of course, confined to industrial policy: much more was needed to be done with respect to the comprehensive reforms outlined by Finance Minister Manmohan Singh. Having seen the effectiveness of centralizing the process in the PMO, A.N. Verma made his steering committee for economic reforms a permanent feature for the following five years of the Narasimha Rao government. The committee met over lunch every Thursday over the next five years, except when A.N. Verma was not in town. Almost all aspects of reforms were first discussed in this relatively informal committee and bureaucratic resistance was hammered in no uncertain terms whenever it came up. The permanent membership of the committee consisted of the secretaries of the main economic ministries: finance, commerce and industry. I had the privilege of attending almost all these meetings on the coat-tails of the successive six industry secretaries over this period. Depending on the subject matter of each meeting, the secretaries of the relevant ministries would be invited in turn. For example, the huge transformation of telecom policy was initiated in this committee, despite the great reluctance of the then telecom ministry, with their officials being dragged, kicking and screaming.
  In addition, Verma set up the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB), which was announced in the Industrial Policy Statement,49 in the PMO but was serviced by the industry ministry. He chaired this personally every Saturday over the following five years. The expectation was that it was this opening of foreign direct investment that might receive the most opposition, so it was important to give a signal that it was regarded with the utmost importance. The original intention was that there would be active solicitation of large multinationals to invest in India. But it was quickly realized that this was not really feasible in the Indian system and the FIPB soon became and remained an approval mechanism rather than a promotional one. It was shifted out later from the PMO to the finance ministry.50
  As a follow-up to the New Industrial Policy, the Directorate General of Technical Development (DGTD) was soon abolished. Although little commented on, this must rank as one of the most important and consequential administrative decisions to be taken at the time. Abolition of any agency is almost unheard of in the Indian government firmament, let alone one that was as powerful as the DGTD. It was the linchpin of the whole industrial ‘command-and-control’ system as described earlier. It had a large staff, which was rendered non-functional in one stroke. Since civil servants in India cannot just be fired, the staff was reassigned to different ministries, but the organization itself lost its existence. Had there been an industry minister, it is highly unlikely that this could have been done. In comparison, for example, even a strong, committed and powerful liberalizer such as Commerce Minister Chidambaram was not able to abolish and disband the Chief Controller of Imports and Exports: this agency was merely renamed as the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), with the same staff continuing in this new avatar, and it continues to exist even today! With the abolition of the DGTD, there was no administrative apparatus left for any kind of administrative industrial controls to creep back into the system, and they mercifully didn’t. As it happened, with the continuation of DGFT, trade reforms took much longer to implement—almost a decade. In any case, with the departure of Commerce Minister Chidambaram in July 1992, there was no driving force to continue with the reforms in a more purposive manner. It is possible that the IMF programme helped in continuing the process despite changes in personnel.
What Was Not Done
Although the 1991 Industrial Policy Statement was comprehensive and self-contained, there were three important elements of industrial policy that were not addressed, presumably due to perceived political difficulties—promotion of industrial restructuring, labour reforms and the abolition of small-scale industry reservations. If these areas had also been addressed in the first flush of enthusiasm for reforms during the 1991–96 period, it is likely that the response of Indian industry could have been such that an East Asian-type high growth might have been possible.
  The first issue had actually been thought about a great deal and found mention in the Industrial Policy Statement, related particularly to the public sector, which already had a number of so-called ‘sick’ enterprises.51 Such enterprises were to be referred to the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction, and a social-security mechanism was to be created to protect the interests of workers likely to be affected.
  Given the comprehensive economic reforms that were being envisaged, it was natural to expect that there would be need for considerable industrial restructuring in light of the new competition and technology modernization that would occur. With the existing labour legislation that effectively prohibited labour flexibility in the industrial sector, and inoperative bankruptcy procedures, the likelihood of smooth industrial restructuring was deemed to be low. Moreover, if the new policies would result in widespread labour distress, the political consequences could be fatal for the success of the new policies. It was also understood that there would be little chance of initiating labour legislation reforms without first putting in place adequate social-security schemes for any displaced labour.
  It is worth recalling that, in recognition of this issue, Finance Minister Manmohan Singh announced the establishment of the National Renewal Fund (NRF) in his 1991–92 Budget speech:
This Fund will provide a social safety net which will protect the workers from the adverse consequences of technical transformation . . . The Fund will not merely provide ameliorative measures for the workers affected in the course of technical change but, more importantly, provide retraining to them, so that they are in a position to remain active productive partners in the process of modernization.
As a follow-up to the industrial policy and the finance minister’s Budget speech, we immediately got to work in the industry ministry. We held widespread consultations with other ministries, including the labour ministry, trade unions and industry bodies. As with other reform activities, this also went through Verma’s steering committee for economic reforms. The NRF was set up by a government resolution on 3 February 1992 to protect the interest of workers affected by industrial restructuring. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs approved the guidelines on 28 October 1992 for operationalizing the NRF. The guidelines were notified on 21 December 1992.52
  The objectives of the fund were:
* To provide assistance to cover the costs of retraining and redeployment of employees arising as a result of modernization, technology upgradation and industrial restructuring.
* To provide funds for compensation of employees affected by restructuring or closure of industrial units, both in the public and private sectors.
* To provide funds for employment-generation schemes both in the organized and unorganized sectors in order to provide a social-safety net for labour needs arising from the consequences of industrial restructuring.
During the ten months or so that it took to set up the NRF in 1992, the government also succeeded in negotiating an adjustment loan from the World Bank for the purpose.
  After all the work had been done, and the World Bank loan disbursed, for reasons that remain unclear to me to this date, the finance ministry resiled from its own initiative and commitment.
  Had the NRF been successfully put in operation, I do believe that the course of Indian industrialization could well have been different over the twenty-five years that followed. In particular, it is possible that progress could also have been made on labour reforms if the NRF had indeed succeeded in convincing organized labour that industrial restructuring was in their favour, and that they actually had appropriate social protection. A concomitant reform that was also necessary was the overhauling of bankruptcy laws in order to enable the kind of industrial restructuring that was envisaged. Work was also done on this issue under the able guidance of the then additional secretary Jagmohan Bajaj53 in the Planning Commission, but there was no follow-up. In the event, a new bankruptcy law has only just been passed in 2016. The NRF, of course, remained stillborn.
  Coming to labour reforms, this was not really part of any thinking at the time. It was perhaps too hot a political potato to handle, and it remains so to this date. The consequence is there for all to see. Industrial growth over the last twenty-five years has mostly been jobless. Prior to reforms, there was obviously a great deal of redundant labour in many large enterprises. With new technology, modernization, new machinery and new practices, a great deal of productivity enhancement took place in industry, so there was little need for new labour. Given the extant labour laws and inoperative bankruptcy machinery, investors were loath to invest in labour-using industry. Unlike China and other East Asian countries, there has been almost no investment in export-related labour-using industries.
  The third issue relates to the reservation of small-scale industries. There was little thinking or discussion on this issue leading up to the 1991 industrial policy reforms. In fact, a perusal of the 1990 policy document would suggest that, if anything, the prevailing views were much more in the opposite direction. As noted earlier, almost all labour-using consumer industries were reserved for the small-scale sector, the very industries where East Asian industrial exporters made their mark in the world. For example, Chinese clothing exports increased from $30 billion to $190 billion between 1990 and 2014, while Indian exports grew from $5 billion to just $18 billion over the same period; similarly, Chinese footwear exports increased from $9 billion to $56 billion over the same period while Indian exports went up from $0.6 billion to only $3 billion. To be competitive even in these industries requires the use of technology, organization, and marketing skills that can really only be done in large firms. In the clothing industry, for example, almost 60 per cent of employment in China is in firms that employ more than 500 workers; in India, in contrast, the legacy of small-scale reservations and continuing restrictive labour legislation is such that more than 90 per cent of employment in this industry is in firms with less than fifty workers.54 These examples give some idea of the industry and employment losses that India has suffered because of these misguided policies ostensibly aimed at preserving employment.
  This brings me to my last significant failure as an advocate of industrial policy reforms. By the mid-1990s, concern with small-scale industry reservation had begun to grow. I had by then moved to head the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER). Around the same time, the Ministry for Agro and Small-Scale Industries asked Abid Hussain to head the Expert Committee on Small-Scale Enterprises. He once again asked me to become the member secretary of this committee, recalling our earlier association in the textile and industrial export committees of the late 1980s. I readily agreed and formed a small secretariat in the NCAER. As it happened, we had already begun research on this issue in the Council.55 As always, under the sagacious leadership of Abid Hussain, we were able to reconcile the many irreconcilable, different vested interests in the sector and emerge with a unanimous report that recommended the immediate de-reservation of small-scale industries.56 We did, of course, recommend a host of consequent promotional measures to help in the transition. I had assumed that, given the credibility of Abid Hussain, the report would gain serious traction and policy action would follow. Alas, this was not to be, and no action was taken until 2002 when about fifty items were de-reserved.57 This was also the period (1996–99) of unstable governments, between Prime Ministers Narasimha Rao and Atal Bihari Vajpayee. De-reservations did continue in dribs and drabs, and it was not until 2015 that the remaining twenty items were finally de-reserved and the list abolished. The irony is that starting around 2001, as a consequence of WTO commitments, almost all these items could be imported freely: large enterprises abroad could export them freely to India, but similar large enterprises in India were not allowed to manufacture them! Yet, successive governments during the period did not regard this issue as a priority, nor was there any pressure at any time from organized Indian industry.
  This sorry tale provides some idea of the political strength shown in carrying out the comprehensive policy reforms in 1991.
  To conclude, the interconnected failure in carrying out reforms related to industrial restructuring, labour legislation and small-scale industry reservations have cost us dearly. Consequently, Indian industry has missed many buses over the last couple of decades and much remains to be done to complete the process started in 1991. One can only hope that, given the consolidation of political power that has now occurred, such reforms can be carried forward and that we can look forward to a new resurgence of industry. With Chinese wages rising consistently, the current time is a great new opportunity for attracting industries that would definitely move out of China over the next decade or so. The current beneficiaries are countries such as Vietnam, Cambodia and the Philippines. There is no reason why we cannot take advantage of this turn of events.
Other Reforms: A Continuous Process in the 1990s and 2000s
The industrial policy reforms, as important as they were, were only the first segment of the comprehensive economic policy process that was set in motion in 1991. The first priority was macroeconomic stabilization, which needed simultaneous action on the fiscal front and on the external sector. Finance Minister Manmohan Singh’s 1991 landmark budget immediately set in motion policy actions that brought macroeconomic stability within one year.
  One of the distinguishing features of macroeconomic policymaking during this period was the very cooperative relationship between the ministry of finance and the RBI resulting in coordinated monetary, banking, fiscal and exchange-rate policies right through the 1990s. In his chapter in this volume, C. Rangarajan provides a first-hand account of the sequence of reforms that were carried out in this realm. The gradual, calibrated sequence of financial-sector liberalization contributed to the maintenance of financial stability throughout the 1990s and 2000s despite the occurrence of the East Asian and North Atlantic financial crises. As documented by Jaimini Bhagwati in his chapter, the sequenced financial-sector reforms enabled the institutional reforms and infrastructure building that were needed to develop the capital market. This process continues to this day and still has some way to go.
  Infrastructure investment is crucial for accelerating the growth process. Although this had been a preoccupation of the planning process, the quality and extent of existing infrastructure was much below par in the 1990s. Power shortages were endemic; there were no four-lane highways; port capacity was inadequate; airports and airlines were underdeveloped; and the railways were severely stretched in terms of both capacity and quality of service. The 1994 World Development Report of the World Bank happened to focus on infrastructure development. I took this opportunity to suggest to Finance Minister Manmohan Singh to commission a similar report for India. He responded by saying, ‘This is your idea, so you do it!’ A distinguished expert committee was assembled, and we took two years to produce a report that proposed commercialization of infrastructure, along with much greater participation of the private sector, which had hitherto not been permitted.58 In their chapter, N.K. Singh59 and Jessica Seddon have skilfully provided a relatively comprehensive account of the many twists and turns that have characterized developments in the infrastructure sector ever since. Despite much progress made since the mid-1990s, Vinayak Chatterjee gives a first-hand view of the difficulties that the private sector faces in contributing significantly to infrastructure investment in the country. This is another area that remains a work in progress despite considerable development in some sectors such as telecommunications, civil aviation and roads. Significant problems continue to dog expansion and modernization of the railways. Although there has been relative success in capacity expansion of power generation, particularly through private-sector investment, much remains to be done in terms of pricing and organizational reform in the sector.
  Among the consequential changes that have slowly begun to take shape as a consequence of loosening of central government economic regulations and control, and retreat of planning, are the evolving contours of Centre–state relations. Y.V. Reddy60 provides an overview of how Centre–state fiscal federalism is gradually shifting fiscal powers to the states. Before coming to the central government in the early 1990s, he had spent most of his administrative career in Andhra Pradesh. As exemplified by his recommendations as chairman of the Fourteenth Finance Commission, he is a clear proponent of getting greater fiscal autonomy to the states. The abolition of the Planning Commission is another move in this direction. The contribution by Laveesh Bhandari shows how states have begun to respond to the new degrees of freedom that they are now experiencing in the economic sphere. These are new uncharted waters of fiscal federalism in India, and we can expect constant adjustments in the years to come.
  The opening up of the Indian economy continued over more than a decade through a continuous process of trade reform, encompassing gradual elimination of trade restrictions on the one hand, and reduction in tariffs on the other. In his chapter, Harsha Vardhana Singh documents the progression of trade reforms in a comprehensive chapter that provides new data on the openness of the economy that has now been achieved. It shows that the current effective tariffs are now not very different from some of the most open economies in the world, even though some foreign perceptions of the economy being relatively closed are yet to change. In his contribution, as one of the most perceptive international economic commentators, Martin Wolf61 has used his long-standing engagement with the Indian economy to provide an external view of how perception of the Indian economy’s stance on trade has changed over the reform period. With India’s newly found status as a market-oriented, open economy, he feels that India will increasingly need to take a leadership role in the evolving global economy.
  As the Indian economy became more open and started becoming significant on the global scene, India’s foreign, strategic and security policies also had to adopt corresponding new approaches and directions. Ambassadors Shyam Saran62 and Shivshankar Menon63 provide first-hand accounts of this progressive change in their insightful essays in this volume. The initiation of economic reforms in 1991 being accompanied by the geopolitical shift that occurred by the fall of the Soviet Union necessitated a fundamental rethinking on the part of the Indian foreign-policy establishment. In his contribution, Sanjaya Baru64 shows how the increasing Indian defence expenditure contributed to the fiscal excesses of the 1990s. He also goes on to document how fiscal prudence that followed the 1991 reforms has served to possibly handicap the Indian defence forces to reduce expenditures.
The Way Ahead
The chapters in this volume document the considerable success of the New Industrial Policy that has indeed lasted over the last twenty-five years. In the initial phase, there was exuberant response from domestic industry in the first five to six years. The ex ante real-exchange rate devaluation had helped in providing some continued effective protection as new competition was introduced, trade restrictions were relaxed and tariffs were reduced. There was some slowdown in the late 1990s as the real-exchange rate caught up and some companies perished because of increasing international and domestic competition. Industrial growth then accelerated again in the 2000s, along with creditable growth in manufactured exports, as meticulously documented by Harsha Vardhana Singh in this volume. After the impact of the North Atlantic financial crisis, there has been somewhat of a pause in industrial growth and exports once again. Global trade has, of course, slowed down considerably, but even within this context, Indian export growth has been too low in recent years, leading to a loss in the Indian share in global trade. Moreover, there is no sign of any pickup in the labour-using industrial activity leading to exports in those areas. With the emergence of balance-sheet stress in many of the largest Indian companies, with a corresponding reflection in banks’ balance sheets, industrial investment is exhibiting a new low, along with that in corporate profitability.
  The time is therefore ripe for new thinking and action on industrial policy to inject new enthusiasm for industrial investment in the country. This has to be done with the realization that the global economic environment is going to be less hospitable than it was in the first decade of this century.
  The great churning that occurred in the late 1990s among the leading companies in the country is documented in a very evocative fashion by Omkar Goswami and Gita Piramal in their respective chapters. As exemplified by Mukesh Ambani, Baba Kalyani and R. Gopalakrishnan, those who grabbed the new opportunities flourished beyond their wildest dreams. Others fell by the wayside. Narayana Murthy, Sunil Mittal, Deepak Parekh and Vinayak Chatterjee illustrate the new entrepreneurship that recognized the new opportunities provided by economic reforms over the years. The largest service-sector companies now eclipse the old industrial titans. While the flourishing of the new service sector is to be welcomed, there needs to be new introspection on how the manufacturing sector can become the leading growth generator for India again. We need to see the emergence of new Indian manufacturing entrepreneurs who can successfully leverage the burgeoning market provided by Rama Bijapurkar’s new Indian consumer to attain competitiveness in international consumer markets.
  Naushad Forbes provides new data on the lack of technology investment in Indian industry relative to East Asian countries, and suggests some solutions. What becomes clear is that Indian industry has simply not evinced enough interest in technology investment and that there has been excessive dependence on foreign technology, without adequate, corresponding domestic technology generation for efficient absorption and substitution. The one area where there has indeed been greater attention to technology investment, both through technology imports as well as domestic technology generation, has been pharmaceuticals. Kiran Mazumdar Shaw has provided us a very personalized account of her own journey in biotechnology: what stands out is the consistent positive support that she received from the government at different levels, particularly, the department of biotechnology. This is unusual in that this technical department provided both promotional and technological support, which helped this nascent industry; being a new department mostly staffed with technical personnel, it does not seem to have exhibited a control mindset. This is a pointer to the kind of promotion that can be done to help Indian industry.
  Average industrial growth in the twenty-five years since 1991 has been around 7 per cent, higher than any previous twenty-five-year period, but not spectacular in comparison with the fast-growing East Asian countries. If India is to ascend to middle-income levels from its current low- and middle-income status, economic growth has to be consistently above 8 per cent a year over the next couple of decades. This cannot be achieved without a consistent growth in industry of around 10 per cent, along with similar growth in services. Even with such a growth, Indian per capita income will only reach the current Chinese level in about twenty years from now. So, there is no time to be lost.
  This will not happen in a business-as-usual context. There has to be a renewed, focused effort towards the revival of Indian industrial growth in a manner similar to what was done almost a quarter century ago. Such an effort would include specific policy reforms in the areas of:
* labour legislation;
* social protection of labour in the context of industrial restructuring, of the national renewal fund variety;
* specific encouragement through fiscal and other measures for large investments in areas that were hitherto reserved for small-scale industries;
* promotion of investment in industrial technology, including both research and development; and
* trade promotion measures, in particular trade facilitation.
The high industrial growth achieved by East Asian countries shows that there was continuous and active organized communication and cooperation between the government and the private sector. Even though it was not as well organized, such communication and cooperation did exist during the 1990s years of reforms, as portrayed by Tarun Das in his chapter. Devising a successful strategy for implementing the kind of reforms necessary for accelerating industrial growth once again, and on a sustainable basis for the future, requires a similar process of continuous interaction between the government and the private sector. It is essential to build such mutual trust for the strategy to be successful. Export growth did respond to the successive opening of the external sector, as shown by Harsha Vardhana Singh in his comprehensive chapter on trade, but once again, perhaps, not as much as had been hoped for. In particular, there has been no exuberant investment in large labour-using export-oriented industry as exhibited by all the successful East Asians.
  A review of East Asian countries that have particularly succeeded in achieving consistently high economic growth shows that consistent attention to human development was a key component of the strategy for rapid economic development. One lasting puzzle of the democratic political economy in India is the consistent neglect of health, education and agriculture through both the earlier import-substituting closed economy period and the period subsequent to the economic reforms. As narrated by Ashok Gulati and Shweta Saini in this volume, policy towards agriculture has seldom received the kind of attention it deserves, except during the green revolution period of the late 1960s and 1970s. The reduction in industrial protection did benefit the agriculture sector but little else has been done. Given that more than half of the Indian labour force is still in agriculture, the case for a major reorientation of policy to agriculture is compelling. Similarly, as shown by Nachiket Mor, Diva Dhar and Sandhya Venkateswaran, despite some attempts at reform in the 2000s, and noted improvements in health outcomes over the twenty-five years since the reforms, public-health services in India remain very poor. The improvements that have taken place are basically due to the tremendous expansion of the private sector. The poor have little recourse to affordable health services. The success stories from other developing countries do suggest a more active role for the state in the financing and delivery of health services; the governance challenges facing the health sector are yet to be resolved.
  A similar situation exists in the education sector, which has seen explosive expansion over the twenty-five years post-reforms, including in higher education as documented by Devesh Kapur in his contribution to this volume. Once again, most successful countries exhibit the provision of free or low-cost education services up to the secondary level. Just as in the case of health, the Indian state has failed in serving its young through a quality education system. That people recognize the value of education is demonstrated by the resources that families are willing to spend, usually beyond their means, at every level. The private sector has responded to the increasing demand at every level but quality remains poor in both the private and public sectors at all levels of education. Once again, policy solutions are yet to be found in this intractable sector.
  As these examples suggest, the way forward for accelerated growth in India is being held back by major governance deficits in all areas connected with the delivery of public goods and services. Sarwar Lateef’s thoughtful contribution on governance provides much food for thought on the way forward. The economic reform process so far has concentrated on empowering the private sector to do what it can do best. But it has done little to empower the public sector, broadly defined, to do what it has to do to serve the public interest. In fact, it is probably the case that the private sector is now being constrained because of inadequate progress in the delivery of public services, particularly those related to human development. The demographic dividend can become a demographic burden if the quality of India’s burgeoning youth population continues to be handicapped by poor health and poor education.
  I hope that this volume will help in focusing our minds to launch a new, focused strategy to accelerate India’s industrial development that will sustain itself over the next quarter century.
Annex 1
GOVERNMENT OF INDIA
MINISTRY OF INDUSTRY
STATEMENT ON INDUSTRIAL POLICY
New Delhi, 24 July 1991
POLICY OBJECTIVES
1. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru laid the foundations of modern India. His vision and determination have left a lasting impression on every facet of national endeavour since Independence. It is due to his initiative that India now has a strong and diversified industrial base and is a major industrial nation of the world. The goals and objectives set out for the nation by Pandit Nehru on the eve of Independence, namely, the rapid agricultural and industrial development of our country, rapid expansion of opportunities for gainful employment, progressive reduction of social and economic disparities, removal of poverty and attainment of self-reliance remain as valid today as at the time Pandit Nehru first set them out before the nation. Any industrial policy must contribute to the realisation of these goals and objectives at an accelerated pace. The present statement of industrial policy is inspired by these very concerns, and represents a renewed initiative towards consolidating the gains of national reconstruction at this crucial stage.
2. In 1948, immediately after Independence, the Government introduced the Industrial Policy Resolution. This outlined the approach to industrial growth and development. It emphasised the importance to the economy of securing a continuous increase in production and ensuring its equitable distribution. After the adoption of the Constitution and the socio-economic goals, the Industrial Policy was comprehensively revised and adopted in 1956. To meet new challenges, from time to time, it was modified through statements in 1973, 1977 and 1980.
3. The Industrial Policy Resolution of 1948 was followed by the Industrial Policy Resolution of 1956, which had as its objective the acceleration of the rate of economic growth and the speeding up of industrialisation as a means of achieving a socialist pattern of society. In 1956, capital was scarce and the base of entrepreneurship not strong enough. Hence, the 1956 Industrial Policy Resolution gave primacy to the role of the State to assume a predominant and direct responsibility for industrial development.
4. The Industrial Policy statement of 1973, inter alia, identified high-priority industries where investment from large industrial houses and foreign companies would be permitted.
5. The Industrial Policy Statement of 1977 laid emphasis on decentralisation and on the role of small-scale, tiny and cottage industries.
6. The Industrial Policy Statement of 1980 focused attention on the need for promoting competition in the domestic market, technological upgradation and modernisation. The policy laid the foundation for an increasingly competitive export base and for encouraging foreign investment in high-technology areas. This found expression in the Sixth Five-Year Plan which bore the distinct stamp of Smt. Indira Gandhi. It was Smt. Indira Gandhi who emphasised the need for productivity to be the central concern in all economic and production activities.
7. These policies created a climate for rapid industrial growth in the country. Thus, on the eve of the Seventh Five-Year Plan, a broad-based infrastructure had been built up. Basic industries had been established. A high degree of self-reliance in a large number of items—raw materials, intermediates, finished goods—had been achieved. New growth centres of industrial activity had emerged, as had a new generation of entrepreneurs. A large number of engineers, technicians and skilled workers had also been trained.
8. The Seventh Plan recognized the need to consolidate on these strengths and to take initiatives to prepare Indian industry to respond effectively to the emerging challenges. A number of policy and procedural changes were introduced in 1985 and 1986 under the leadership of Shri Rajiv Gandhi aimed at increasing productivity, reducing costs and improving quality. The accent was on opening the domestic market to increased competition and readying our industry to stand on its own in the face of international competition. The public sector was freed from a number of constraints and given a larger measure of autonomy. The technological and managerial modernisation of industry was pursued as the key instrument for increasing productivity and improving our competitiveness in the world. The net result of all these changes was that Indian industry grew by an impressive average annual growth rate of 8.5% in the Seventh Plan period.
9. The Government is pledged to launching a reinvigorated struggle for social and economic justice, to end poverty and unemployment and to build a modern, democratic, socialist, prosperous and forward-looking India. Such a society can be built if India grows as part of the world economy and not in isolation.
10. While the Government will continue to follow the policy of self-reliance, there would be greater emphasis placed on building up our ability to pay for imports through our own foreign exchange earnings. Government is also committed to development and utilisation of indigenous capabilities in technology and manufacturing as well as its upgradation to world standards.
11. Government will continue to pursue a sound policy framework encompassing encouragement of entrepreneurship, development of indigenous technology through investment in research and development, bringing in new technology, dismantling of the regulatory system, development of the capital markets and increasing competitiveness for the benefit of the common man. The spread of industrialisation to backward areas of the country will be actively promoted through appropriate incentives, institutions and infrastructure investments.
12. The Government will provide enhanced support to the small-scale sector so that it flourishes in an environment of economic efficiency and continuous technological upgradation.
13. Foreign investment and technology collaboration will be welcomed to obtain higher technology, to increase exports and to expand the production base.
14. The Government will endeavour to abolish the monopoly of any sector or any individual enterprise in any field of manufacture, except on strategic or military considerations, and open all manufacturing activity to competition.
15. The Government will ensure that the public sector plays its rightful role in the evolving socio-economic scenario of the country. The Government will ensure that the public sector is run on business lines as envisaged in the Industrial Policy Resolution of 1956 and would continue to innovate and lead in strategic areas of national importance. In the 1950s and 1960s, the principal instrument for controlling the commanding heights of the economy was investment in the capital of key industries. Today, the State has other instruments of intervention, particularly fiscal and monetary instruments. The State also commands the bulk of the nation’s savings. Banks and financial institutions are under State control. Where State intervention is necessary, these instruments will prove more effective and decisive.
16. The Government will fully protect the interests of labour, enhance their welfare and equip them in all respects to deal with the inevitability of technological change. The Government believes that no small section of society can corner the gains of growth, leaving workers to bear its pains. Labour will be made an equal partner in progress and prosperity. Workers’ participation in management will be promoted. Workers’ cooperatives will be encouraged to participate in packages designed to turn around sick companies. Intensive training, skill development and upgradation programmes will be launched.
17. Government will continue to visualise new horizons. The major objectives of the New Industrial Policy package will be to build on the gains already made, correct the distortions or weaknesses that may have crept in, maintain a sustained growth in productivity and gainful employment and attain international competitiveness. The pursuit of these objectives will be tempered by the need to preserve the environment and ensure the efficient use of available resources. All sectors of industry whether small, medium or large, belonging to the public, private or cooperative sectors will be encouraged to grow and improve on their past performance.
18. The Government’s policy will be ‘continuity with change’.
19. In pursuit of the above objectives, the Government has decided to take a series of initiatives in respect of the policies relating to the following areas: 
a) Industrial Licensing.
b) Foreign Investment.
c) Foreign Technology Agreements.
d) Public Sector Policy.
e) MRTP Act.

India’s 1991 Reforms: A Retrospective Overview
Montek Singh Ahluwalia1
Much has been achieved in the twenty-five years since the reforms began but as the old problems were solved, new ones have surfaced and solving these needs new initiatives that will have to be as far-reaching as the original reforms were.
In one sense, economic reforms are a continuing process, because policies are regularly modified to improve performance or respond to new challenges. But every now and then, we witness a paradigm shift in the way the economy is managed. The 1991 reforms in India are special because they represent precisely such a shift.
  The need for policy changes had become evident by the end of the 1970s, when it was clear that India was lagging behind other East Asian and South East Asian countries. Analysts, both inside and outside government, argued persuasively that India’s poor performance was due to the stifling controls over private-sector activity and the insulation of the economy from global competition because of import controls, high tariffs and a generally negative approach towards foreign investment. These controls began to be moderated in the 1980s, at first in a limited way under Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in the first half of the decade and then more aggressively in the second half under Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. These changes had a favourable impact on growth performance, raising the average growth rate of GDP to 5.6 per cent in the 1980s, as opposed to only 2.9 per cent in the 1970s. However, the policy changes, though important, were not systemic. They introduced flexibility at the margin but left the control system itself in place, liable to reversal at any time.
  By the end of the 1980s, it was clear that a more fundamental change was needed and the reforms of 1991 signalled the start of this change. A quarter century later, it is necessary to look back and see what worked and what didn’t. This paper presents a retrospective assessment using two somewhat different approaches. Section I focuses on the design of the reforms, whether it was appropriate, and how it was implemented in practice. Section II focuses on the outcomes. Did the reforms succeed in their stated objectives in terms of growth and other goals?
I. Issues Related to the Content of the Reforms
The 1991 reforms were introduced in the context of a severe balance-of-payments crisis and, as such, consisted of two components. One was a conventional macroeconomic consolidation package aimed at reducing the fiscal deficit to lower aggregate excess demand, which had spilled over into the balance of payments. The other component was a package of structural reforms, designed to raise productivity and make the economy more competitive, laying the foundations for more rapid growth.
  It is the structural reform component that signalled a paradigm shift in the way the economy was to be managed. The earlier suspicion of the private sector—and of markets in general—gave way to a new emphasis on freeing the creative energies of the private sector by allowing it to respond to market forces. It was explicitly stated that the domestic industry had been excessively protected for too long through high tariffs and import controls, making it inefficient and uncompetitive. The new strategy signalled a reduction in the level of protection and a shift to a much more open economy, in which self-reliance meant exports paying for imports with a modest requirement for external capital flows. In addition, it was proposed that historical fears of foreign direct investment—the ghost of the East India Company—be laid to rest and foreign investment be welcomed as an instrument for modernizing Indian industry. The public sector had traditionally been viewed as occupying the commanding heights of the economy. There was no invocation of privatization rejecting the public sector on ideological grounds, but it was clearly asserted that the public sector was expected to perform efficiently, or shut down if it couldn’t stop making losses.
  Several questions arise about the design of the reforms and how they were implemented. Were the 1991 reforms comprehensive enough to cover a sufficient range of areas, and were they appropriately sequenced? Were they thrust upon a reluctant government solely under pressure from the IMF and the World Bank? Was the pace of implementation too slow? Were they incomplete in the sense of not being followed up by a second generation of reforms and, if so, what should these reforms have attempted? My answers to these questions are summarized below.
Was the 1991 Package Sufficiently Comprehensive and Well Sequenced?
The reform package was clearly much more comprehensive than anything attempted earlier. Its comprehensiveness can be seen from the following ten most important changes mentioned in the Budget speech.
(i) Industrial licensing was abolished for all but a handful of industries where it was retained for either strategic reasons or because of environmental sensitivity.
(ii) Abolition of licensing also meant that the location of industries was no longer decided by the government as part of the licensing approval but by the entrepreneur, subject to local government approvals.
(iii) The list of industries earlier reserved for the public sector was drastically reduced from eighteen to eight.
(iv) Control over investment by the so-called ‘large houses’ covered by the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act, intended to discourage the concentration of wealth, was abolished.
(v) FDI, which was earlier allowed only up to 40 per cent of total equity, and that too subject to discretion, was freely allowed up to 51 per cent of total equity in a large range of industries. In addition, a Foreign Investment Promotion Board was set up to actively pursue FDI.
(vi) Industries were allowed to freely enter into agreements for technology transfer as long as the royalty payments were within stipulated levels as a percentage of turnover.
(vii) There was major liberalization of foreign trade, with import controls abolished for intermediate goods, capital goods and components, all of which could be freely imported against tradeable import entitlement licences (called exim scrips) issued to exporters at 30 per cent of export value (40 per cent in some cases).2
(viii) A new policy was articulated towards public-sector enterprises, under which loss-making PSUs deemed non-revivable would be closed down.
(ix) A phased programme of tax reform covering direct and indirect taxes was to be undertaken based on the recommendations of the Chelliah Committee.
(x) A programme of financial-sector reforms was to be undertaken based on the recommendations of the Narasimham Committee.
The first six items listed above were implemented in the very first year. In the case of trade policy (item vii), the exim scrip arrangement introduced in July 1991 was quickly replaced by a dual exchange rate on 1 March 1992, which, in turn, was replaced by a unified market-determined exchange rate on 2 March 1992. In the short space of two years, investment controls on the private sector were more or less abolished, and the rigid import-licensing system was also dismantled, and all items of capital goods, components, intermediates and raw materials were made freely importable. The fact that decontrol of investment occurred simultaneously with trade liberalization was an important act of sequencing, since otherwise, the industrial decontrol would have been negated by the need to get import licences.
  The liberalization of trade policy simultaneously with an initial devaluation, followed by a shift to a flexible exchange rate, was another example of sensible sequencing. The exchange rate was very significantly depreciated over a two-year period, and this made it possible to liberalize import controls and reduce import duties with far fewer problems than would have arisen if trade liberalization was not accompanied by exchange-rate depreciation.
  The exclusion of finished consumer goods, such as garments, processed foods, household appliances, consumer electricals, scooters and cars, from the initial stages of liberalization was also a conscious sequencing decision, since most of these items were produced by a large range of smaller and middle-sized industries and would have needed more time to face competition. However, as we argue later, the liberalization of this segment was unnecessarily delayed.
  An important feature of the 1991 reforms is that the extent of the change in policy, which was very considerable, was deliberately underplayed for political reasons. Jairam Ramesh (2016) reported that when the proposed changes in industrial policy were presented to the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, there was a strong negative reaction from senior Congress party politicians, who saw it as a reversal of traditional Congress policies. However, the same proposals were found acceptable later when presented along with a preamble that acknowledged the contributions of earlier Congress prime ministers, outlining the changes as a continuation of a long-established tradition of modifying policies in the face of new challenges. Instead of a forthright declaration that fundamental change was needed, it was found more practical to emphasize continuity to avoid dissension within the party. This is an example of political considerations leading to a conscious choice of ‘reform by stealth’. While it had some advantages in the short term, it is evident that it also had long-term disadvantages, since it kept the political class locked into older slogans.
Were the Reforms Home-grown?
The reforms were severely criticized by opposition parties and the large community of left-leaning academics opposed to liberalization, on the grounds that they were thrust upon a reluctant but helpless government by the IMF and the World Bank as the price for providing financial assistance. Since issues of sovereignty often cloud debates on public policy, it is worth putting the record straight on this issue.
  There is no doubt that the new government, which took office on 21 June 1991, faced a desperate situation. Foreign-exchange reserves were down to $1.1 billion—roughly within two weeks of imports—and a fear of default was in the air. Support from the IMF and the World Bank was absolutely necessary, and it would not have come without conditionality. It is also true that the reforms announced in 1991, including both the reduction in the fiscal deficit and the structural reforms in industrial, trade and public-sector policy, were incorporated in the agreement with the IMF/World Bank financing. However, it would be wrong to believe that the reforms were thrust upon an unwilling government. I have outlined in some detail the build-up of the internal thinking in the years preceding the reforms, and it is clear that many of the steps taken in 1991 had been discussed internally and had supporters within the government.3
  It is fair to say that the crisis became the occasion for the reformers within government to push for what they had been talking about. I have no doubt that in the absence of a crisis, these changes might not have been made so quickly. It is to the credit of the Narasimha Rao–Manmohan Singh duo that they did not ‘waste the crisis’. In an article I wrote for the Economic and Political Weekly (2016), I mention four reasons why one can argue that there was internal commitment to the reforms, independent of pressure from the international financial institutions. First, in some areas, notably trade liberalization and the shift to a market-determined exchange rate, the reform package went well beyond what the IMF and World Bank were advocating. Second, the reforms consciously excluded any commitment to privatization, which was a part of the then prevalent ‘Washington Consensus’, but would not have been acceptable politically. Third, the balance-of-payments crisis was over by the end of 1993, and if IMF pressure was the only factor pushing the reforms, the process would have ended in 1993. On the contrary, reforms continued subsequently, though admittedly at a slower pace. Finally, despite the opposition to the reforms when they were introduced, the political process worked in such a way that the reforms were continued by the succeeding United Front Government, and was carried on by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA government that followed. In other words, even as there was considerable political posturing and criticism of the reforms when they were first announced, there was a working consensus of sorts, which extended beyond the Congress party and made it possible for the reforms to be carried forward by subsequent governments.
Was the Pace of Implementation Too Slow?
It is a fair criticism of the reforms that implementation was very slow. The original reform strategy did envisage gradual implementation and not a ‘big bang’ approach. While industrial controls were lifted in a big-bang manner, the trade reforms, the reform of the exchange-rate system, and the reduction in import duties took place more gradually. Similarly, financial-sector reforms and tax reforms were also expected to be rolled out in a phased manner. However, it would be fair to say that the actual implementation was significantly slower than gradualism alone would justify.
  As noted above, the first two or three years saw a fairly impressive pace of implementation in the area of industrial decontrol, trade liberalization and the shift to a market-determined exchange rate, as well as the start of a process of duty reduction. Some elements that were not in the original list of reforms were implemented quickly as well. For example, the liberalization of FDI inflows was accompanied by a parallel liberalization of inflows from Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) towards the end of 1992, allowing them to invest in shares and bonds through stock exchanges. This window ensured a substantial inflow of funds in subsequent years.
  At the same time, there were long delays in implementing many elements compared with targets announced. For example, P. Chidambaram, as the finance minister of the United Front government, lowered the peak rate of duty to 40 per cent and the capital goods duty to 20 per cent in 1997–98, and also stated that further reductions were needed, implying that our import duties would be lowered to ASEAN levels in three years, i.e., by 2000. Unfortunately, the NDA government, under Atal Bihari Vajpayee, did not follow through on this component of the reforms, nor did the Congress-led UPA government, which took office in 2004, pick up the thread. The present position is that sixteen years after the target date was announced in 1997–98, our duty rates are still higher on average than of ASEAN countries though the difference has narrowed.
  The retention of quantitative restrictions on consumer goods is another area where policy action was inordinately delayed. The logic that competition from imports would help achieve cost efficiency and improve product quality applied just as forcefully to the consumer-goods sector as to others. As noted above, the initial decision to leave consumer goods out of import liberalization was a tactical decision to avoid wide-ranging protests at the start of the liberalization process, but imports of consumer goods should have been liberalized a few years later. However, it actually happened only in 2002, following a World Trade Organization (WTO) ruling against India on a case brought by the United States Trade Representative, arguing that quantitative restrictions on imports were only allowable on balance-of-payments grounds, and there was no sign of balance-of-payments stress in India. A voluntary liberalization of consumer goods, without the compulsion of a WTO ruling, would have provided an opportunity to explain the rationale of the move to the domestic industry, which could have been given WTO-compatible protection through tariffs, with the tariff level declining steadily over time.
  Implementation of public-sector reform also fell far short of intention. It was clearly stated when the reforms were unveiled that the public sector must achieve higher levels of efficiency and must be given autonomy of decision-making, but units that continued to make losses would be closed down. This was not done for fear of a backlash from the labour unions, which were well represented in all the political parties. Subsequently, sale of equity to a strategic partner with management control was envisaged for some units, and one or two decisions to implement this policy were taken, but became controversial. A fresh attempt is now being made, based on recommendations made by the NITI Aayog, the successor institution to the former Planning Commission, to sell some public-sector units along with management control and to close down others. It remains to be seen how effectively this will be implemented
  Opening the insurance sector to private participants is another example of slow implementation. The Insurance Act made insurance a government monopoly and the need to introduce competition was recognized as a legitimate objective. The finance ministry appointed the R.N. Malhotra Committee to make recommendations in this area, and the committee recommended that an insurance regulatory authority be established to spell out the regulatory structure under which all insurers would work, after which private-sector insurers could be allowed to enter with foreign partners holding a minority stake. A statutory authority was put in place in 1999 by the NDA government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee. However, when the Insurance Act had to be amended to allow private sector entry into insurance, differences arose on the extent of foreign equity that foreign partners could hold, and it was finally limited to 26 per cent. This was widely regarded as too low and the industry, including the Indian partners, was in favour of raising the limit to 49 per cent. The UPA government, which came into power in 2004, made several attempts to raise the foreign equity limit, but could not get support from the BJP and the Left. Ironically, it was the NDA government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi that was able to make the change in 2016. This example illustrates how reforms requiring legislative changes can become hostage to political posturing, but it also shows that parties which opposed the reforms when in opposition can end up supporting them when in power.
  It is often said that the slow pace of reforms in India is due to the conscious choice of gradualism as a strategy. Gradualism has indeed been a preferred strategy, but it is not clear whether gradualism is the best description to apply to the Indian reform strategy. Logically, gradualism should mean giving a clear indication of where we want to get, but only stretching the transition over a longer time period to give people more time to adjust, or to build a broader consensus. However, this approach implies that the time period and the pace of transition should be clearly indicated at the start of the process so that people begin to adjust accordingly.4 India’s reforms have not been gradualist in this sense. Instead, they have often consisted of giving a broad direction, but without specifying a time path for the transition. Progress is then made in the broad direction outlined, with movement occurring as and when it is politically convenient. This is not so much ‘gradualism’ as ‘opportunism’. It can work under some circumstances, but it doesn’t make the case for reform sufficiently strongly to win public support. It also leaves investors confused on the reform signals, which means investments made on the assumption that the reforms will be carried through can prove infructuous.
  Looking ahead, it is clear that the nature of democratic politics will continue to affect the pace of reforms. Democracy is not a consensual form of government: it is inherently an adversarial form, in which it is the business of the opposition to oppose. This creates less of a problem when the government commands a strong majority and political opposition can be managed through negotiation and compromise, especially when the underlying issue is one on which there is a broad base of consensus. The recent successful passage of a constitutional amendment to facilitate the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), which is a major step towards modernizing India’s indirect tax system, is a good example of how party positions that appear intractably opposed can be reconciled on issues where there is a broad base of public support. However, not all the reforms that are needed enjoy the broad base of support that the GST did.
  The lesson to be learnt from the experience thus far is that much greater effort is needed to build public support on key elements of the reform agenda. This is especially necessary in the absence of a crisis when there is a real danger of complacency setting in. For example, we seem to be doing well at present, with growth above 7 per cent, but we are nowhere near achieving the objective of transiting to 8 to 10 per cent growth, which is necessary to fulfil the growing aspirations of the people. We will certainly not be able to make this transition unless economic reforms are accelerated, and to do this, it is important to make a clear case for acceleration, which often means having to face unpleasant truths and taking on vested interests.
  One can easily understand why politicians favour reforms by stealth, because it suggests that one can achieve what one wants without disturbing the hornet’s nest of vested interests. However, this is unlikely to succeed in an active participatory democracy like India, where all interests have ample opportunity to have their say. It can work briefly in crisis situations, but in the end, those who want change have to build sufficient consensus for change. This is why the best we have been able to do is to build a strong consensus for weak reforms. To transform that into a strong consensus for strong reforms is the real challenge.
II. Assessing the Impact of Reforms
We now turn to an assessment of the reforms in terms of outcomes. The Twelfth Plan, which covered the period 2011–12 to 2016–17, had a subtitle that presented a tripolar objective: ‘Towards faster, more inclusive and sustainable growth’. This section presents a brief assessment of performance in each of these three areas.
Impact of Reforms on Growth
Since the rethinking on economic policy in the 1980s was motivated by the realization that India’s growth performance did not compare well with East and South East Asian countries, it is appropriate to begin with an assessment of the impact of the reforms on growth. Table 1 summarizes the growth rate in different sub-periods, treating 1991–92, which was the year of the crisis when growth dipped to 1.4 per cent, separately. Growth rates are presented for India and also for comparator countries or country groups for the period after 1980 from the IMF’s World Economic Outlook database.
  Table 1: Growth Rates of GDP Pre- and Post-1991 (per cent per year)
 
*The growth rates in this row are from the national accounts that relate to the fiscal year 1 April to 31 March. All other rows show growth rates for the calendar year from the IMF WEO database. Thus, the growth rates based on national accounts data for 1980 to 1990 are for the period 1980–81 to 1990–91, and so on.
The following are the main points relating to India’s growth experience pre- and post-reforms, which emerges from the table.
(i) The growth rate of the economy in the three decades prior to the 1980s averaged only 3.5 per cent per year. It was a little higher in the first two decades and deteriorated to 2.9 per cent in the 1970s. This is the background in which policy rethinking of the 1980s took place.
(ii) The growth rate in the 1980s improved to 5.6 per cent, reflecting the positive impact of the incremental reforms undertaken in that decade, mainly in the second half. However, some of this growth was fed by an expanding fiscal deficit in the later years of the decade, which laid the foundations for the balance-of-payments crisis in 1991. The growth rate of 5.6 per cent recorded in the 1980s was, therefore, not sustainable.
(iii) In the first five years of the post-crisis period, i.e., 1992–93 to 1996–97, the economy grew at 6.5 per cent, which was significantly better than in the 1980s. It slowed down to 5.4 per cent in the next six years, 1997–98 to 2002–03, possibly reflecting the impact of the East Asian crisis, which led to a tightening of monetary policy in 1998 and also contributed to some worsening in the investment climate. This was also a period when economic reforms had slowed down, which may have had some effect on private investment intentions. Nevertheless, the average growth rate in the first ten years of the post-reforms period was around 6 per cent, about half a percentage point higher than in the 1980s.
(iv) The story of India’s growth in the 1990s compared to the 1980s and its relationship to reforms has been the subject of interesting debate in literature. Bradford de Long first pointed in 2001 out that despite the hype around the reforms of 1991, the growth rate in the 1990s was not much different from the 1980s, when there was very little by way of reforms and only a more ‘business friendly’ approach in operating the control system. On this basis, he argued that perhaps this business-friendly approach, and not reforms, was what mattered the most. In 2004 Dani Rodrik and Arvind Subramaniam came to the same conclusion, but went further to argue that perhaps the external liberalization undertaken in the 1991 reforms had been given undue importance by many analysts because of the importance ascribed to external liberalization in the Washington Consensus. In their view, it was the business-friendly approach of the government that mattered much more than external liberalization. I have argued in Ahluwalia (2016) that the Rodrik–Subramaniam proposition that external liberalization was not important is questionable for four different reasons. First, as noted above, the 5.6 per cent growth in the 1980s was in part fuelled by an excessively expansionary fiscal policy and was, therefore, not sustainable. Second, retaining a system of discretionary control but operating it in a business-friendly manner is not the best way of building a strong private sector. In fact, it poses a serious risk of degenerating into cronyism. Third, opening the economy in the early 1990s was critical for the long-term health of the economy. We would not have seen the explosion in IT services and software development if external liberalization had not occurred. Finally, the gradualist nature of the reforms meant that many of the changes were implemented only over time and, therefore, their full impact was probably felt only after the 1990s. The rapid growth experienced after 2003 is perhaps due to these lags working their way through the system.
(v) The thirteen-year period (2003–04 to 2015–16), which shows an average growth rate of 7.8 per cent, can be viewed as a vindication of the economic reforms. This period too can be divided into the first five years—2003–04 to 2007–08—before the financial crisis, when the economy grew at 8.7 per cent, and the next eight years—2008–09 to 2015–16—when it averaged only 7.2 per cent. The slower growth in the second period was partly a reflection of a global downswing and partly the emergence of domestic constraints, widely described as ‘policy paralysis’ in the last two years of UPA II, ending May 2014. The issue of whether the UPA government could have dealt better with the domestic constraints is a legitimate subject for study, but is beyond the scope of this paper. The point to emphasize for the present is that the average of 7.8 per cent growth for the entire thirteen-year period is an impressive demonstration of the impact of reforms on India’s growth performance.
It is relevant at this stage to ask whether the high growth experienced by India in recent years was due to policy or simply to the buoyant state of the world economy during most of the 2000s. Table 1 shows the comparative picture of India’s performance relative to China and other relevant groupings using the IMF’s World Economic Outlook data. The following conclusions emerge from Table 1: (a) India’s growth performance was poorer than China’s through most of the period, though the differential between the two narrowed in the later periods as China’s growth slowed down. In 2015–16, India’s growth, at 7.3 per cent, exceeded China’s at 6.9 per cent; (b) India’s growth performance was poorer than the ASEAN five in the 1980s, and also in the earlier years of the 1990s up until the ASEAN crisis, but it was much better than the ASEAN five after 1997–98; (c) India’s growth performance has been consistently better than Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa; and (d) India’s performance is also better than all EMDE countries excluding India and China in all the sub-periods.
  Based on this, it is reasonable to conclude that India’s growth performance in the post-reforms period has been commendable. It certainly belies the fears of the many critics who, when the reforms were first introduced, predicted that they would have a disastrous effect on the economy and that the opening up would kill domestic industry. On the contrary, the economy has done well, better than in the past and also better than all other groups other than China.
Impact on External Vulnerability
The reforms were much criticized on the grounds that import liberalization would make us vulnerable to balance-of-payments crises, necessitating repeated recourse to the IMF, with a consequential subordination of national policies to the diktat of the IMF. These fears have also proved baseless, and India has not needed the IMF since the 1991 crisis.
  India did experience external stress in the years after the Eurozone crisis when the current-account deficit increased to 4 per cent of GDP in 2011–12, thanks to a sharp increase in oil prices and a domestic fiscal policy that was excessively expansionary. The current-account deficit widened further to 4.7 per cent of GDP in 2012–13, much of it due to sharp increases in gold imports, which played the role of speculative capital outflows anticipating a depreciation. The ‘taper tantrum’ in April 2013 created uncertainty, putting pressure on the rupee, which depreciated from $1=Rs 54.4 in April 2013 to $1=Rs 63.2 in August, a depreciation of 16 per cent in four months.
  Fortunately, timely corrective steps helped stabilize the situation without any need for the IMF. These steps included firm assurances of the following kind: action to reduce the fiscal deficit by P. Chidambaram, who had returned to the finance ministry in the second half of 2012; action to limit gold imports, which were playing a role similar to capital outflows; and unconventional action by the Reserve Bank of India in supporting Indian banks obtaining forward cover for dollar deposits from NRIs. The flexible exchange rate introduced by the reforms also helped by avoiding the need to defend an increasingly unrealistic exchange rate. The fact that reserves were built up in good times paid rich dividends in the form of a sizable cushion of reserves of over $320 billion, which helped to stabilize expectations. It is worth noting that although the current-account deficit in 2012–13 was much larger as a percentage of GDP than in the crisis year of 1990, the situation was managed without recourse to the IMF.
Has Growth Been Inclusive?
While the growth performance has been indisputably impressive, the record on inclusiveness is mixed. The Indian debate on inclusiveness has traditionally focused on poverty reduction, and experience in this dimension has been good, as documented below. But the Twelfth Plan had identified many different measures that were also relevant, including the growth of employment opportunities, the provision of essential public services to the poor, interregional inequality, and inequality across households. Much more needs to be done in these areas.
  Trends in poverty reduction based on the Tendulkar Committee poverty line applied to the NSS consumer surveys are presented in Table 2.
  Table 2: Percentage of the Population and Absolute Number in Poverty (Tendulkar Committee Poverty Line)

Poverty Ratio 
(Percentage of the Population)
Absolute Number of Poor 
(Millions)
1993–94
45.3
403.7
2004–05
37.2
407.1
2011–12
21.9
269.3
In the eleven-year period immediately following the reforms, from 1993–94 to 2004–05, the percentage of the population in poverty declined significantly. However, the total population had increased in this period, and the absolute numbers in poverty actually increased marginally. This is basically similar to the pattern observed in earlier estimates of poverty based on the pre-Tendulkar poverty line, not reported above because the poverty lines are not comparable. The situation changed dramatically in the later period from 2004–05 to 2011–12. The percentage of the population in poverty declined much more sharply than earlier, and for the first time, there was also a sharp reduction in the absolute numbers below the poverty line—from 407 million in 2004–05 to 269 million in 2011–12.
  These data refute the somewhat pessimistic assessments offered by many sceptics that growth has not benefited the poor.5 The scale of poverty remains very large, but there is little doubt that the rapid growth witnessed in recent years has reduced the scale of the problem. It is useful to consider the different mechanisms that may have been at work. Three possible mechanisms suggest themselves.
(i) First, there is the pure growth effect. GDP growth in the second period was much faster, with GDP growing at 8.5 per cent per year compared to 6.2 per cent in the first period. If we look at growth in per capita GDP, which is actually more relevant for poverty reduction, the proportional difference is more dramatic. Per capita GDP grew at 6.8 per cent per year in the second period, compared to only 4.4 per cent per year in the first period. Faster growth in per capita income would imply that for any given degree of ‘trickle down’ built into the growth process, we would expect a faster reduction of poverty
(ii) The ‘quality of growth’ is also important in determining the extent of the trickle-down. Some growth processes, e.g. those dependent primarily on mineral exploitation, do not lead to a wide spread of benefits, whereas growth processes that involve faster growth in agricultural GDP are much more likely to do so. As it happened, agriculture grew much faster in the second period, at 4.2 per cent per year, compared to only 2.7 per cent in the first sub-period, and this must have contributed to a greater decline in poverty.
(iii) Finally, the second period also saw an intensification of anti-poverty schemes, especially the rural employment guarantee programme plus various schemes to support rural livelihoods. Anti-poverty schemes represent what may be called a ‘direct attack’ on poverty, independent of the more general effect of aggregate growth and even sectoral growth.
All three factors enumerated above are relevant, but advocates of poverty reduction tend to focus exclusively on direct programmes of poverty reduction, dismissing (i) and (ii) above as mere trickle-down approaches. Not enough research has been done quantifying the contribution of each factor in any specific period, or in a particular state. This is a particularly valuable area for future research, especially focusing on the relative effectiveness of these three factors in the different states.
  Employment creation is another dimension of inclusiveness and one that is much discussed globally. Complaints about ‘jobless growth’ are commonly heard in many industrialized countries, and similar complaints can be heard in India too. However, it is important to recognize that there are some special features of the problem in India. Open unemployment rate is not a good indicator of the scale of the problem. The unemployment rate in India varies from a low of around 3 per cent of the labour force, to a high of 7 per cent, depending on the particular definition of employment used, but the important point is that whichever measure of employment we use, the rate of unemployment does not show a significant increase over time. For example, the Usual Principal and Subsidiary Status (UPSS) measure shows unemployment of 3.17 per cent in 2004–05, falling marginally to 3.14 per cent in 2011–12. The reason why open unemployment is not a good measure of performance in this area is that in a developing country, where incomes are generally low and there is no social security, people are too poor or vulnerable to remain openly unemployed. They therefore take whatever job is available, even if the remuneration it yields is very low. In effect, many of those who are counted as employed in the statistics are actually underemployed.
  The problem lies not in the lack of total employment opportunities generated, but in the quality of the employment. In 2016, Santosh Mehrotra reports that in 2004–05, total employment was estimated at 459.1 million, with almost 82 per cent in the unorganized sector and only 18 per cent in the organized sector. Furthermore, of those in the organized sector, only about 46 per cent were in formal employment with social-security protection, while the other 54 per cent were ‘informally’ employed, without full benefits. This latter category includes casual daily labour and contract workers. By 2011–12, the total employment had increased to 474.3 million, an increase of only 3.3 per cent over seven years. This looks very low, but the labour force had also expanded by 3.1 per cent in this period, reflecting a large increase in school intake as a result of the drive to increase schooling. The rate of unemployment, therefore, actually fell.6 Total employment in the organized sector increased by 75 per cent from 58.2 million to 101.6 million, increasing the share of the organized sector to 21.4 per cent. However, as much as 84 per cent of the increase in employment in the organized sector consisted of informal hiring so that the share of informal employment in the organized sector increased from 54 per cent in 2004–05 to 67 per cent.
  The critical employment challenge in the years ahead is how to encourage sufficient growth in formal employment in the organized sector. Mehrotra estimates that such employment increased by only 6.8 million in the seven-year period of 2004–05 and 2011–12, or less than one million per year. Against this, the labour force is expected to increase by about 7 to 8 million per year, which could be higher if the presently very low female-participation rate increases. Most of the new entrants are better educated and have high aspirations for good-quality jobs in the organized sector, with some degree of social security. Although one should expect that many of them would be absorbed in well-paid self-employment, even if half the increase, or say, about 3.5 million, look for formal employment, that is much larger than the estimated addition of 1 million jobs per year in formal employment in the recent past.
  It is important to recognize that there is no inconsistency between a very good performance in poverty reduction and a poor performance in providing good-quality employment. A decline in poverty only requires an increase in incomes in agriculture accruing to self-employed small farmers and higher wages for casual labour in both agriculture and construction, the latter being a sector that can readily draw unskilled labour from rural areas. While expanding employment in these areas are positive developments, they are of little interest to the better-educated youth entering the labour force, who are no longer looking only for low-quality employment opportunities that will only raise them slightly above the poverty level. They are looking for absorption in regular employment in the organized sector, a dimension in which performance thus far has been very poor.
  The expectations of the younger and better-educated new entrants to the labour force can only be met through faster growth, especially in relatively labour-intensive manufacturing, which requires relatively low levels of skill. The organized sector needs to expand more rapidly than the unorganized sector, and with employers in the organized sector being willing to expand formal employment. This calls for action on several fronts. Since the most labour-intensive firms are small or middle-sized, it is necessary to create an economic environment where these firms flourish and expand. The objective should not be to simply keep a very large number of very small-scale operations in business, but to encourage new small firms to enter and grow to a level where they can provide good-quality employment. Their growth will displace the less successful small firms in the same area, but this structural churn has to be accepted.
  The areas where action is needed to achieve these objectives are well known. They include:
(i) creation of improved infrastructure, especially availability of good-quality power and improved transport and logistics;
(ii) improving the ease of doing business with both state government and central government agencies;
(iii) removing biases against the growth of the organized sector vis-à-vis the unorganized sector (plugging tax avoidance would help greatly in this context and the introduction of the GST will help);
(iv) introducing sufficient flexibility in labour market policies, including flexibility in laying off labour, to encourage firms to expand their formal labour force;
(v) and finally, removing distortions in the land market that have become a major constraint according to Ghani et al. Action is being taken in some of these areas, but it is not clear that it is sufficient. Relatively little progress has been made thus far in addressing labour and land market constraints.
The third dimension of inclusiveness where India’s performance is also disappointing is in the provision of essential public services such as health, education, clean drinking water and sanitation. This failure has been extensively discussed in literature, see in particular Amartya Sen’s and Jean Drèze’s An Uncertain Glory: India and its Contradictions (2015). The good news is that the situation is improving in both these areas, but the bad news is that it is not improving as fast as one would have hoped for. There has been a substantial increase in the coverage of primary education, which is now being expanded into secondary education, but problems of quality remain serious, especially in rural areas. Unless the poor have access to good-quality education, the expansion of enrolment will not help much and will certainly not level the playing field to provide equal opportunity.
  Progress in the delivery of public health services is also inadequate. All the health indicators are improving, but in many respects, especially relating to sanitation and child malnutrition, India’s performance is poorer than that of other low-income countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. It is also poorer than neighbouring Bangladesh as Sen and Drèze have shown.
  Faster progress in both education and health is not only critical for improving the welfare of the bulk of the population, it is also critical for economic expansion. No country has been able to achieve rapid growth of GDP for an extended period without raising the levels of education and health of the bulk of the population to reasonable levels. China had achieved this before it entered its high-growth phase. India is probably just getting to where China was twenty years ago. The solution calls for action in two different dimensions. First, it certainly requires much larger government expenditure in the provision of these services. Expenditure by both the Centre and the states on education and health needs to be increased by at least 3 percentage points of GDP over the next five years. This will have to be fitted within the fiscal constraints of both the central government and the state governments, which in practice requires prioritization within the expenditure budget, including phasing out subsidies to those who don’t really need them, combined with mobilization of additional budgetary revenues. Second, it calls for substantial improvements in state capacity to ensure that increased expenditure actually delivers results. The delivery of these services is the responsibility of state and local government functionaries, and therefore, most of the improvement in delivery systems has to be orchestrated at that level.
Has the Growth Been Sustainable?
Finally, it is relevant to ask whether the faster growth generated in the post-reforms period has been sustainable. This is perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the performance. Rapid growth is bound to generate environmental stress, which takes many forms. It includes:
(i) erosion of forest cover because of felling of trees;
(ii) pollution of natural waterbodies such as lakes and rivers because of dumping of untreated sewage, industrial effluents and run-off of fertilizers and pesticides;
(iii) local air pollution due to burning of fossil fuels and other unsupervised incineration of municipal waste, along with crop residues, and construction activity without precautions to prevent spread of particulate matter;
(iv) traffic congestion in cities due to inadequate transport planning and absence of public transport;
(v) increase in soil salinity from excessive watering and fertilization;
(vi) accumulation of municipal solid waste in urban areas and unscientific methods of waste disposal;
(vii) and finally, emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere because of burning of fossil fuels, leading to global warming.
Of the seven negative consequences listed above, the last is a global problem, and it can be argued that an optimal effort can only be made with global cooperation and some agreed system of burden sharing. We have seen some progress in this area recently, but not enough, and the new US administration has signalled some rethinking which adds to the uncertainty. However, the other six are essentially local problems where the benefits of action taken to control negative effects are all internal to the economy. There is no excuse for not taking action to control these negative effects. The need to do so has been known for quite some time, but it has not been translated into effective policy formulation and implementation. The result is that whether we look at forest cover, water quality or air quality, the situation is actually deteriorating.
  In the case of forest cover, which is critical for groundwater recharge and to protect against soil erosion, the present level of 23 per cent by area is very far below the target of 33 per cent, and although there has been a marginal upturn in the area under forest, the quality of the cover has deteriorated. In the case of water, all our major rivers are heavily polluted and, in most stretches, are well below bathing quality. This is because most of the sewage generated in the cities flows untreated into these rivers. The total sewage treatment capacity in India is only about 30 per cent of the total urban sewage generated and even that is not fully utilized. Industrial effluents are also not adequately treated before being dumped into natural waterbodies. The inability (or more likely, unwillingness) to impose strict control on small-scale units, threatening them with closure if they don’t comply, is an important explanatory factor. Air quality in Indian cities has deteriorated alarmingly, and the WHO recently declared Delhi as the city with the worst air quality in the world. The World Bank has estimated that the cost of high air pollution in India is as much as 8.5 per cent of GDP.
  In short, we have some way to go before we can arrest the ongoing deterioration in most environment-related indicators, and it will obviously be an even longer haul before we can actually reverse the deteriorating trend. The good news is that most of this can be tackled if there is determination and political will. Containing these undesirable consequences of unsustainable growth calls for high-quality design of regulation, optimal structures of pricing and penalty to discourage polluting activity, combined with firm enforcement. Unfortunately, the regulations that exist in these areas are poorly designed and even more poorly enforced. Enforcement is largely in the realm of state governments, and vested interests are strongly entrenched. Better regulation will inevitably involve higher costs, but this is only giving teeth to the principle that the polluter must pay. In practice, the costs would be borne largely by the higher-income population, and in the absence of effective action, the cost of pollution is borne disproportionately by the poor.
  Fortunately, this is an area where public consciousness has begun to increase and the shortcomings are increasingly being pointed out by the media. The judiciary has also been more active in intervening in environmental issues. While judicial intervention is no substitute for effective regulation and enforcement, it helps to raise consciousness and provides an area of focus for NGOs to complain. It remains to be seen whether all this can be translated into determined action by both the central and state governments.
  To summarize, there is much that has been achieved in the twenty-five years since the reforms began, but as the old problems were solved, new ones have surfaced, and solutions to these need new initiatives that will have to be as far-reaching as the original reforms were.

Remembering 1991 . . . and Before
Omkar Goswami
It seemed like the ushering of a new India. The signals were just right—of a government that had finally shown purpose by leveraging a major economic crisis to kick-start the much-needed fiscal and industrial reforms.
The word ‘pentimento’ describes hazy images that sometimes peep through layers of over-painting on old canvases. Trying to remember the world of 1991 in 2016 is exactly that—dim images of a quarter century ago that briefly appear in one’s memory, overlaid by myriad changes that have occurred since. Here are some:
Telephones. Unless you were a politician, bureaucrat, an ‘important’ person or a ridiculously persevering soul, it was virtually impossible to get a telephone in any of the main cities. The hard fact: in 1990–91, India, with a population of 839 million, had just 4.5 million telephone lines, or a teledensity of 0.53 phones for every 100 citizens. Owning this princely possession didn’t mean that you could connect to the chosen few who did. Quite often, the phone was unusable because there was no dial tone, engaged for no obvious reason, or cross-connected. There was virtually no direct dialling outside the city limits. Local calls were not charged according to their length or time of day: it was 25 paise per call.
Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), or canned cooking gas. There were two choices: either wait till eternity or use your connections to jump the colossal queue. For the middle class that didn’t have LPG, the only other choice was kerosene. To get it, you needed a ration card, perhaps the most valuable document in pre-1991 India. Without an LPG connection, you were entitled to 6 litres every fortnight, available in most parts of Delhi on the first and second of the month, and then on the fifteenth and sixteenth.1
Bank tokens. With ATMs and Internet transactions, few from today’s urban India will remember the sheer tedium of banking in the early 1990s. You first deposited the cheque at one counter and received a numbered brass token. Many entries were made in different ledgers as the cheque tortuously made its way to the cash counter, which could take three quarters of an hour on peak transaction days. The cashier would holler your number, and you would rush to get the money and escape.
A cash-and-queue economy. In 1991, for all practical purposes, there were no debit cards, no credit cards and incredibly few cash machines. It suited many. Unless you were a salary earner in the organized sector, what you earned or spent could not be tracked; and what you paid as taxes, if you did so at all, was entirely based on what you thought would pass muster. If it didn’t, it was a matter of ‘adjustment’ between the tax officer, you and your chartered accountant. No transparency of data or systems meant a cash-and-queue raj for virtually any transaction involving the state. Although there were occasional instances of big-time graft, such as the Bofors scandal, Indian corruption up to the early 1990s was pervasive but small-time: getting rail tickets faster than others; jumping the queue for driving licences; paying a series of small bribes to each clerk at the port or airport to sign at different places in the import documents—grafts that were considered to be an integral part of the system, essentially ‘speed’ money arising out of over-controlled, non-transparent systems.
Kores stencils, pink correcting fluids, duplicating ink and Gestetner Roneo machines. In 1991, very few offices had computers; none had laser jet printers. Documents were either carbon copied or mimeographed—a term that is beyond the realms of understanding of a thirty-year-old today. Up to four copies were typed with carbon papers. For more, the document was typed on wax-paper stencils, on which the typos were first covered by a hideous pink correcting fluid, which had to dry, and were then typed over. The final document was taken to a Gestetner Roneo machine. The operator would coat the top of the machine with black duplicating ink, get smudged in the process, thread the stencil and let it rip. The first five copies were over-inked. The next fifteen were passable. After that, he had to re-ink and repeat the process. Every large office and government department had this critical device.
Office of the Textile Commissioner. The genesis of India’s control-and-permit raj predates the Nehruvian era. It came into being during the Second World War under the Defence of India Rules promulgated in 1939. Many legislations, rules and offices that existed in the early 1990s—such as the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, the Imports and Exports (Control) Act, the Chief Controller of Imports and Exports, the Cement Controller, the Iron and Steel Controller, and the Textile Commissioner—came into being under the Defence of India Rules.2
  My favourite example of the control raj is the Office of the Textile Commissioner, which was given the regulatory function of administering prices, distribution and control of mill-made cloth meant for civilian consumption. It was bureaucracy at its most absurd.
  Even in 1991, the textile commissioner insisted that a factory classified as a cotton textile mill could not weave any fabric without the weft and warp containing cotton yarn. So, ‘cotton mills’ could weave blended cloth using yarn consisting of cotton and polyester fibre, but not nylon or polyester filament yarn (PFY) fabrics. In such a setting, these mills still manufactured pure synthetic cloth, but in an utterly wasteful way. Mills would tightly double-weave cloth where both the warp and the weft were dominated by synthetic yarn with some ‘face-saving’ cotton. This apparently blended grey cloth passed the textile commissioner’s scrutiny because it contained cotton yarn. Thereafter, the cloth was given an acid bath to burn out the cotton. Thus was born a diaphanous synthetic bolt, at a huge cost to the system.
  Then there were the regional offices of the textile commissioner, each with supposedly awesome regulatory power, yet universally under-budgeted, underpaid and overstaffed. The regional head of the Coimbatore office, for instance, ran out of money to fill diesel in his jeep by the second week of the month. The denouement: complete dependence upon the mill owners for everything, including a Scotch or two and dinner at the Coimbatore Club.
  By 1991, the Office of the Textile Commissioner had become a joke: headed by worthless bureaucrats; staffed by underpaid people; and doing absolutely nothing to help turn around a crippled, seriously ailing composite mill sector. Yet, it existed then. More absurdly, it continues up to now, claiming that it has a ‘very strong, technical and economic wing manned by professionally qualified and experienced officers’ across eight regional offices.
  Indian Airlines. As I write, Indian Airlines—now a part of Air India—continues to dive into its financial and organizational destruction. It was in dire straits even in 1991, except that nobody cared to recognize it. There was no competition. Each of us who flew in the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s has at least one horror story of a sudden strike-driven delay; inordinately long lines in the check-in counters; uncalled for rudeness; shabby service; the timetable being a figment of the imagination unrelated to actual arrivals and departures; and the genuflections to politicians and local bureaucrats who could, and often did, delay flights to suit their convenience. Indian Airlines epitomized the inefficiency of a government-owned and cocooned service enterprise, whose motto seemed to be, ‘First, service to us the employees; then the netas; followed by the babus; and finally, a tiny residual for the silly customers bereft of choice’.
  Yet, there was change. The most profound in urban India was a nifty little car, a four-wheeler that had everything that no Indian automobile ever did.
The Maruti 800. On 14 December 1983, Indira Gandhi inaugurated the assembly line of the Maruti factory at Gurgaon, neighbouring Delhi, and presented the first car key to one Harpal Singh.3 Demand far exceeded supply, as the Indian middle-class discovered that it could finally own and drive well-engineered, fuel-efficient yet peppy, and small but extremely comfortable cars at reasonable prices, which were far superior to the Fiats, Ambassadors and Standard Heralds of the land. Maruti owners claimed unheard-of speed with fuel efficiency, and zipped around everywhere with their car ACs at full blast. Those who were still driving Ambassadors derogatorily called the Marutis ‘dinky toys’. Envy aside, a change had come. Irreversibly.
  Maruti not only created a new market for automobiles but also led to the setting up of a quality- and precision-driven modern industry in and around Gurgaon to produce and supply automobile ancillaries—the first of its kind in India. Companies such as Sona Koyo, Asahi India, Rico, Minda, Amtek, Shakti and Wheels India started as ancillary suppliers to Maruti, were coached in Japanese shop-floor practices of quality, manufacturing perfection and productivity, and eventually became major corporations that they are today. Much of the initial establishment and subsequent growth of today’s $50-billion auto-components industry has to do with Maruti, which started the auto revolution in 1983.
Reliance’s Naroda and Patalganga plants. In late 1984, I visited Reliance’s Naroda plant in Ahmedabad, which manufactured polyester fabrics sold as ‘Vimal’—already a powerful brand in India. I was met by Anil Ambani, then all of twenty-five years old. In a city of decaying composite mills with ancient spindles and sclerotic looms, here was a plant advanced beyond dreams. The Naroda facility was the most modern textile mill in India by a long shot, and among the best in the world. It had a state-of-the-art texturizing unit to convert partially oriented polyester yarn to PFY; high-speed spinning facilities to make yarn out of polyester staple fibre (PSF); Japanese air jet and Swiss broad-frame rapier looms to weave shirting, saris and wide-width suiting at very high speeds and astounding quality; and processed close to a million metres of fibre and piece-dyed fabric per month.
  That was not all. In October 1982, Anil’s brother, Mukesh Ambani, started a new plant at Patalganga, in the foothills of the Western Ghats, some 70 kilometres from Bombay, to manufacture PFY out of purified terephthalic acid (PTA) and mono-ethylene glycol (MEG). By 1986, Patalganga was producing PSF, also from the same sources. In 1988, it backward integrated to manufacture PTA and paraxylene, so that a single feedstock—naphtha—could produce vast amounts of PSF and PFY for a market that was rapidly shifting to blended and synthetic fabric.
Computerized railway reservation system. Before 1985, the time-honoured way of getting a railway reservation was to go very early to the reservation counter, fill a slip and stand in a long line. Eventually, the clerk would laboriously examine a huge ledger to check whether he could accommodate your request. Often to no avail. At which point, there would be much to-ing and fro-ing between the passenger and the clerk about alternative trains and dates, with other sweaty passengers in the line getting increasingly infuriated.
  Then came computerized reservations designed by Tata Consulting Services (TCS), then a division of Tata Sons. It started with Delhi in 1985, and moved on to Bombay, Madras and Calcutta. The change was amazing. The lines still existed, but the reservation clerk could immediately know the status of available berths and seats on any date for all trains between two cities, without going through manual ledgers. Suddenly, the transaction time reduced quite dramatically. Passengers got computerized tickets. There were no errors between the berths allotted at the reservation counter and those actually allocated on the trains.
The Change: July 1991 and Thereafter
By 21 June 1991, when Pamulaparti Venkata (P.V.) Narasimha Rao was sworn in as the ninth prime minister of India, the economy was in tatters. In 1990–91, wholesale or producer price inflation was at 10.3 per cent—the highest in a decade. Consumer-price inflation for industrial workers was at 11.6 per cent. With no check on expenditure, the combined fiscal deficit of the central and state governments had crossed 9 per cent of GDP. Public debt of the central and state governments rose to almost 71 per cent of GDP. The current-account deficit of India’s balance of payments was close to 3 per cent of GDP, the highest in decades; and hawking the State Bank of India’s and the Reserve Bank’s gold reserves did nothing to dent the huge shortfall in foreign currency, which had plummeted to less than three weeks of imports.4
  It was not just that the balance-of-payments crisis was at its tipping point. The economic situation was disastrous everywhere you looked. Decades of poor lending practices coupled with inadequate recognition and insufficient provisioning of bad debts had led to a seriously weakened banking system. Entrepreneurial growth was stultified by a pervasively restrictive environment of industrial licensing, extensive public-sector reservations, a dysfunctional anti-monopolies law, severe limitations on the use of foreign exchange and over 900 products kept reserved for small-scale industries. Competition was further curtailed thanks to a peak tariff of 300 per cent, backed by some of the highest customs duties among industrializing nations and a massive list of quantitative restrictions on imports.
  It was time for radical change. The new finance minister, Manmohan Singh, fully understood the gravity of the crisis. Luckily for him, so did his prime minister, thanks to the efficacy of some key civil servants and his principal secretary, Amar Nath Verma, who made a powerful case for reforms. Some immediate tasks needed to be done.
  The first was the exchange rate. Although it had drifted down through the economic chaos of 1989, 1990 and the first half of 1991, the rupee was still highly overvalued. There came two sharp currency depreciations—on 1 July 1991 followed by 3 July—that were pushed through as executive fiat; they devalued the rupee by almost 18 per cent. The depreciation created some breathing room. But only just. Much more was needed for India to claw out of its self-dug hole.
  The second was the big bang of 24 July 1991. Since end-June, two teams were working at breakneck speed. One at the Ministry of Finance was focusing on crafting the Union Budget, which was to be presented to the Parliament on 24 July 1991. The other, at the Ministry of Industry, led by Rakesh Mohan, was drafting a major statement on industrial policy. A.N. Verma got Narasimha Rao’s permission to announce, in a single day, 24 July, both sets of reforms—the industrial and the fiscal.
  The day started with the Statement of Industrial Policy. After twenty-two paragraphs of pious messages, the policy got down to real reforms.
* Substantial abolition of industrial licensing. Arguing for ‘bold and imaginative decisions designed to remove restraints on capacity creation’, it announced that irrespective of levels of investment, ‘industrial licensing will henceforth be abolished for all industries, except [for] those specified’. Activities that still needed licensing were pruned to fifteen categories—down from the hundreds that existed earlier.5
* Reducing public-sector reservation. The number of industries reserved exclusively for the public sector was slashed from seventeen to seven, which were mostly related to defence, atomic energy and mining.6 It was as if an unbearable weight of the state had been lifted to allow entrepreneurship and private industry to breathe again.
* Curtailing the scope of the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices (MRTP) Act. After explicitly recognizing that ‘interference of the government through the MRTP Act in investment decisions of large companies has become deleterious in its effects on Indian industrial growth’, the policy (i) eliminated the process of pre-entry scrutiny of investment decisions by the so-called MRTP companies; (ii) repealed the ambit of MRTP in mergers, amalgamations and takeover; and (iii) committed to the Act being restructured to eliminate the legal provision that required prior government approval for both the expansion of existing undertakings and the establishment of new undertakings.
* Easier approval of foreign investments. The policy approved direct foreign investment up to 51 per cent foreign equity in high-priority industries, without any procedural bottlenecks. Although this was politically clothed for ‘high-priority industries’, the list was long enough to cover most industries that mattered in India.
Then came the Union Budget. I remember sitting in front of the TV watching Manmohan Singh deliver his first Budget speech. It was a dramatic moment, not because of Singh’s flair for oration, of which he has none, but of the promises of a new dawn that rode on the Budget.
  ‘There is no time to lose,’ Singh said. ‘Neither the government nor the economy can live beyond its means year after year. The room for manoeuvre, to live on borrowed money or time, does not exist any more.’ Making a strong case for credible fiscal adjustment and macroeconomic stabilization, he exhorted the nation ‘to make necessary sacrifices to preserve our economic independence and restore the health of our economy’.7
  Manmohan Singh’s first Budget was tough; but with it came several reforms.
* Divestment: Up to 20 per cent of the Government of India’s equity in selected state-owned enterprises was to be divested in favour of mutual funds and investment institutions in the public sector, which was estimated to yield Rs 2500 crore to the exchequer during 1991–92.
* Freeing of interest rates: The RBI had already given commercial banks freedom to charge interest based on risk perceptions, subject to a stipulated floor rate. Singh extended this to term-lending development finance institutions (DFIs), subject to a minimum interest rate of 15 per cent. He also removed all caps and floors on interest rates for corporate debentures floated in the capital market.
* Empowering the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI): Although the SEBI was set up before 1991, the legislation to give it adequate regulatory and rule-making powers was not enacted. Singh committed to doing so in the fiscal year. This ended the reign of the Controller of Capital Issues and started the journey of an independent regulator for the capital markets and stock exchanges in India.
* Banking reforms: To fix the health of Indian banks and DFIs, Singh proposed to appoint a high-level committee under M. Narasimham, an ex-RBI governor, to consider all aspects of structure, functions and procedures of the financial system. The committee’s report ushered in the first set of significant reforms in banking.
* Reducing tax on dividend income and long-term capital gains: The former was cut from 25 per cent to 10 per cent and the latter from 45 per cent to 10 per cent.
* Freeing the inflow of foreign currency: Two schemes were proposed. Under the first, foreign-exchange remittances could be made to any person in India, none of which would be taxed or scrutinized by the exchange-control authorities. Under the second, the State Bank of India was to issue US-dollar India Development Bonds of a five-year maturity for non-resident Indians and overseas corporate bodies. There was no investment ceiling for these bonds; interest was tax free; and there was full exchange-rate protection.
* Reducing peak import duty: The rate was cut from 300 per cent to 150 per cent, with the exception of imported alcoholic beverages and passenger baggage.
* Reducing import duty of capital goods and their components: Import duty was reduced from 85 per cent to 80 per cent for the former, and from 75 per cent to 70 per cent for the latter. This speaks volumes of how protected we were at the time.
  Singh ended the speech with uncharacteristic flourish. Before commending the Budget to Parliament, he said: ‘As Victor Hugo once said, “No power on earth can stop an idea whose time has come.” I suggest to this august House that the emergence of India as a major economic power in the world happens to be one such idea. Let the whole world hear it loud and clear. India is now wide awake. We shall prevail. We shall overcome.’
  At the time, it seemed like the ushering of a new India. The signals were just right, of a government that had finally shown purpose by leveraging a major economic crisis to kick-start the much-needed fiscal and industrial reforms. Most English-language and all financial dailies praised the Budget; economists loved it; corporate honchos sang hosannas; and the left parties hated it with a vengeance. The stock markets reacted positively. On 24 July 1991, the day of the Industrial Policy Statement and the Union Budget, the Sensex, the Bombay Stock Exchange’s (BSE’s) key index, was ruling at 1596. By 24 December 1991, it was at 1909—up by almost 20 per cent in five months.

The Political Economy of Reforms: The Art of the Possible
T.N. Ninan
Reform measures have been introduced where change has involved little pain because there are few losers, or where careful political management has been possible, or where the issue has no political resonance.
No country at India’s stage of development (e.g. with more than four-fifths of adults not literate, in 1951) has experimented successfully with full-fledged democracy—universal adult suffrage with a multiparty polity in a federal structure—and achieved peaceful transfer of power, not once but over and over again. Similarly, no fully functioning democracy has successfully attempted market-oriented reforms when its per capita income was as low as India’s was in 1991.1 Those living at the edge of subsistence, or below even a minimalist poverty line, are not natural customers for market-oriented reforms, given that markets cannot give weight to the concerns of those without purchasing power.
  The textbook answer to the problem is that it is the function of politics to take care of the losers in the economy by arranging for capacity-building and/or income transfers, in cash or kind. But what if the majority consists of losers, and such transfers in a poor economy are not fiscally feasible so that there is no social-safety net? How do politicians, answerable to voters every five years, push ahead with policies that manifestly serve the interests—at least for the foreseeable future—of the minority that is part of the market? Welcome, therefore, to the political economy of market-oriented reforms, and the complex challenges of pursuing them in a poor country with a democratic system.
  What does one mean by ‘reforms’? You could legitimately consider a programme that dramatically extends the reach of the banking system to be ‘reform’—such as the Modi government’s Jan-Dhan initiative, which simplified the opening of a bank account by eradicating the need for an opening balance; or the digitizing of land records so that they become more easily accessible. However, when discussing the political economy of reforms, the focus must necessarily be on those issues that involve choices that create losers as well as winners. The ambit would, therefore, include changing ownership and market structures, taxation and income transfers, incentives and disincentives; most importantly, it would involve changing the way in which prices are set and, consequently, who gets how much of the surplus. The outcome of all this must be judged on the primary yardsticks of efficiency, income growth and equity. So, while the tasks are technical and have to do with the tools of economics, the choices and outcomes are deeply political.
The Logic of Incrementalism
When he was criticized in the mid-1990s for going slow on the reforms programme, Manmohan Singh used to quote Bismarck, that politics was the art of the possible. What is defined as ‘possible’ expands quite naturally in an atmosphere of crisis, since every crisis is also an opportunity. Singh seized the opportunity in 1991, when the country was teetering on the edge of international bankruptcy, and earned his place in India’s history. Since then, though, every government, including Singh’s own, has chosen discretion over the path of valour when it comes to reform, preferring a gradualist, piecemeal approach to more radical agendas. In explanation, Arvind Subramanian, chief economic adviser in the finance ministry, has argued recently that radical reform is possible only in a crisis; the rest of the time, it can only be incremental reform.
  That might be true, but crises come in different shapes and forms. One sort has an immediacy about it that demands urgent action, such as shipping gold overseas, as India did in 1991 to ward off international default. But there are other, quiet crises that creep up on you—the scarcity of good jobs; stubbornly low incomes on low-productivity farms that, regardless, are asked to support ever more people; the country falling behind on education and healthcare attainments and, therefore, at risk of losing the demographic dividend presented by a one-time bulge in the working-age population; or the water crisis that is already affecting millions. Each of these is a big enough issue to be trajectory defining for a society and economy, but none of them has the actionable immediacy that forces itself to the top of any political agenda in a meaningful way.
  A good example of resisting immediate costs on the premise of long-term payoffs comes from the electricity sector. Building a reliable supply network usually involves pricing reform. But customers facing higher tariffs tend to protest, especially if they are used to enjoying subsidies. And the history of Indian politics is that the votes have gone invariably to those who have promised jam today: subsidized or free power. The link that underpriced power has with the country’s endemic power shortages is rarely made, or simply ignored.
  A second challenge comes from taking on organized interests, such as teachers’ unions, because delivering better educational performance will necessarily mean tackling widespread teacher absenteeism. It is natural for politicians to want to sidestep such issues, preferring outcomes that have winners without losers, or at least many more winners than losers. The preferred phrase in the 1990s was ‘making an omelette without breaking the egg’. One could say that populist bribing of voters and protecting the interests of organized groups are the two principal ways in which politics intrudes on economic reforms.
An Omelette without Breaking the Egg
Politicians who are secure about their continuance in office and their constituencies can afford to risk ‘breaking the egg’. But the Indian reality is that no political party since 1989 had won an absolute majority in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament, until Narendra Modi’s victory in 2014. There is the further complication that the Rajya Sabha, the upper house, is modelled on the US Senate: one-third of its members retire every two years. The different election cycles for the two houses mean that majorities in one house change faster than in the other. As a consequence, most recent governments that enjoy the confidence of the Lok Sabha have not commanded a majority in the upper house for the bulk of their tenure. Perhaps the best example of what results in an environment of bitterly competitive politics is the case of the goods and services tax, universally considered to be a good thing but blocked by the BJP in the upper house when the Congress ruled, and, in turn, blocked for two years by the Congress after the BJP came to power. The Bill enabling such a tax was finally passed more than six years after it was introduced.
  The choices become most political when they involve farmers—numerically large, often financially stressed, and politically assertive. Agro-based industries such as sugar have, therefore, seen the greatest market aberrations and the most frequent and pervasive government intervention, with controls on pricing, distribution and export/import. As for an agricultural input like fertilizer, prices were not raised for a decade, a period in which there was no fresh investment in the industry, leading to a sharp increase in import dependency.
  Given these very real political challenges, it is only to be expected that reform measures have been introduced where change has involved little pain because there are few losers; where careful political management has been possible; or where the issue has no political resonance. Where it has not been so, politicians have paid no heed to the economists rooting for market-oriented policy changes. The hard fact is that all prime ministers have been politically risk averse.
  Against this backdrop, consider three examples of successful, and relatively painless, reform. The first goes back to the initial reform thrust that Singh undertook as finance minister in July 1991: the devaluation of the rupee that was combined with a simultaneous slashing of tariff levels. Ordinarily, lower tariff levels would make imports cheaper and expose domestic producers to greater competition from overseas. You would expect, therefore, that such a measure would be opposed by domestic business lobbies. However, the opportunity to drop tariff levels—and for good measure to abolish key export incentives—came because the rupee had been hopelessly overvalued in the run-up to 1991. A three-stage devaluation over two years, 1991 to 1993, dropped the rupee’s exchange rate from Rs 18 to the dollar in 1991, to Rs 31 in 1993. This meant that an imported item that cost $10 (Rs 180) in 1991, but attracted 150 per cent tariff protection, would have had a domestic cost of Rs 450. In 1993, the same item imported at an exchange rate of Rs 31 but attracting only a third of the old duty level (i.e., 50 per cent), would cost Rs 465.2 Local producers enjoyed less nominal protection but higher increased effective protection.
  In actual fact, the average duty on commodities dropped only from 72.5 per cent in 1991–92 to 46.8 per cent in 1993–94, while the peak rate dropped from 150 per cent to 85 per cent.3 Thus was tariff reform combined with rupee devaluation to be transformed into painless medicine; the inflation effect of devaluation was reduced through tariff cuts, even as the competitiveness of domestic industry was protected through devaluation, which neutralized the effect of the tariff cuts. Yet, both steps were rightly characterized as reforms. Indeed, Manmohan Singh as finance minister told the author in the early 1990s that he had spent ‘sleepless nights’ to make sure that the extent of tariff cuts would not damage domestic industry.
  Take the next two of the business sectors that have been success stories in the post-reform area: aviation and telecom. Both sectors had inefficient, government-owned monopoly operators; both provided services of poor quality; and both had dissatisfied customers looking for change (or choice). Still, the reform undertaken was carefully crafted to mollycoddle the government-owned legacy players. In aviation, private airlines were initially allowed to fly domestic routes in the guise of air-taxi services—a piece of legal fiction because air taxis do not have flight schedules, whereas the services that were launched did. Ownership was restricted to Indian nationals, resident and non-resident, and there were stipulations on the minimum size of aircraft. Later, foreign companies were allowed to invest—but not if they were in the aviation business—in order to make sure that investment did not come packaged with sector expertise! It took more than a decade before international routes were opened up to domestic private airlines, but came with arbitrary restrictions. The legacy government-owned airline, Indian Airlines, was expected to hold its own in the domestic market, given the strength of an established network. In the event, despite its passenger traffic declining steadily, it made modest profits in most years, helped by the fact that it had a fully amortized fleet of ageing aircraft.
  Two decades would pass before it was dethroned as the largest domestic carrier. The transition to a competitive marketplace had happened, but no companies had been privatized, no jobs had been lost, and no one had been forced to give up the safety of public-sector jobs to face the uncertainties and rigours of private-sector employment. What is more, by 2015, India’s domestic aviation market had grown more than tenfold in twenty-five years, and emerged as the world’s fastest-growing aviation market, clocking over 20 per cent growth.4 Intense competition had led to cut-throat fares so low that they invited railway passengers to consider flying as an option.
  Thus was a success story wrought through the introduction of private-sector competition into a government monopoly, scripted without anyone feeling the pain of reform. Amidst the success, though, public-sector mismanagement continued; in fact, it got worse. After a disastrous merger of Indian Airlines with the government-owned international carrier Air India, and the ordering of large numbers of new aircraft that led to huge financing costs, the merged Air India began notching up record losses; even then, employees of the hopelessly overmanned airline did not feel the pain.
  It has been a similar story in telecom. In 1991, teledensity was hopelessly low (0.6 lines per 100 population, having improved from 0.3 per 100 in 1981); waiting lists for new connections ran to a decade and more. As in aviation, private-sector competition was introduced in a carefully calibrated fashion: new companies could offer local services but were shut out of the then very profitable long-distance traffic; in each telecom area, only two private mobile operators were allowed to compete with the government-owned company. But that was enough to raise teledensity to more than 4 per cent in 2002, before lower tariffs, more open competition and explosive growth took it to more than 80 per cent by 2015.
  The government companies were unable to compete and became marginal players, except in legacy landlines, now the much smaller component of the business. They were also deep in the red, with losses more than equal to revenue in many years. However, there was no pain for employees because the government continued to bankroll the companies. The bill was only a fraction of the massive revenues that the private telecom companies served up to the government—through spectrum fees, revenue-share prescriptions and taxes on profits. In effect, customers were paying, but mobile telecom tariffs were low by international standards and no one had cause to complain.
The Pricing Challenge
In contrast to these two cases where painless reform was possible, change has been difficult to introduce where it has meant inflicting pain. This is most notable in the sectors where long-standing pricing distortions have caused subsidies to balloon and wasteful consumption to flourish. Electricity, for instance, has been an area where politicians have traditionally felt obliged to offer supply at less than cost, especially but not only to farmers. Almost nowhere in the country is the average power tariff at a commercially viable level.
  Yet, the endemic shortages of electricity forced the government in the 1990s to invite private investment in power generation—investment that had to be offered a reasonable return. Changes in the law to facilitate this were introduced in 2003. The assumption was that investment in power would be made financially feasible by charging consumers a commercially viable rate, or the subsidy paid by the state government concerned so that the electricity sector remained ring-fenced from political pricing decisions. The results were encouraging, up to a point. In the decade to 2015, half the new generating capacity created was by private companies, and for the first time the country had enough capacity to provide all the power that was demanded by customers; power shortages came down sharply in many states.
  However, the promised pricing reform did not happen, nor did state governments pay all the subsidy bills as they were obliged to. The power distribution companies were caught in the middle between suppliers and consumers, with revenue that was lower than the cost. They borrowed from banks and, when that course reached the end of the road, simply limited their buying and distribution of electricity. The result in certain parts of the country was bizarre: generating companies could deliver more electricity but there was no one to buy it, and consumers wanted more power but it wasn’t being supplied. The central government has tried more than once to incentivize pricing reform, with limited success. As a national average, revenue has tended to fall short of cost by about 25 per cent.5 Partial reform clearly has its perils.
  The trick, of course, is to depoliticize pricing. How to do it has been shown in another energy sector that has been dogged by political pricing—petroleum products. In slow, hesitant stages, the government first stepped out of the picture for the pricing of petrol, then of diesel, leaving both to market forces, with prices to be adjusted every fortnight or month so that each change was no more than a pinprick. The government has also taken the initial steps to reform the pricing of cooking gas and kerosene. The success of this pricing reform suggests that baby steps, taken at regular intervals, achieve better end results than big, infrequent price revisions. In electricity, however, the regulatory architecture that was to oversee pricing reform—by making it non-political—was undermined and therefore rendered ineffective.
The Labour Market
If political pricing has been one of the big political stumbling blocks in the way of reform, labour law reform has been an even bigger one. India’s labour laws seek to protect primarily the organized section of the labour market, which is represented by trade unions. But anything up to 90 per cent of India’s workforce is engaged in the unorganized sector, where an unregulated market operates without the intervention of trade unions or the effective application of protective rules, such as minimum-wage stipulations. Nevertheless, politicians have focused on the smaller corner of the labour market, leaving the bulk of the labour force to its own devices.
  To make matters worse, a series of changes in the 1970s and early 1980s made the organized labour market segment even more rigid. Retrenchment and layoffs were made exceedingly difficult, and pulling down shutters required government permission, which rarely, if ever, came. These changes were driven by a concern for the fate of workmen in declining industries, such as large textile-weaving units threatened with cheaper competition from power-loom units in the informal sector, and troubled engineering units in the state of West Bengal, which at the time was marked by militant trade-union activity. It didn’t help, because more than 100 textile mills of Mumbai shut down anyway after a prolonged strike in 1982 and never reopened; large numbers of engineering units in West Bengal also shut down, even after the government took charge of running some of them.
  At the same time, the tighter laws had the perverse effect of discouraging employment-intensive industries of the kind that flourished in China, making garments, toys and shoes. Legacy workers in the organized sector were protected after a fashion, but those looking for jobs (unorganized and therefore inchoate) were the losers. Denied the abundant resource of labour at competitive wages to rival East Asia and neighbouring Bangladesh, the country’s manufacturing sector has been stunted, accounting in 2014 for just 16 per cent of GDP—lower than for almost every country in East Asia.6 The resulting failure to move workers from farms and into factories has meant that agriculture too has been a stressed sector. It contributes to 16 per cent of GDP but engages half the workforce—yielding, on average, income per worker that is one-sixth of non-agricultural work.
  Nevertheless, any attempt to reform the labour laws and do no more than restore the status quo ante to pre-1980, is automatically characterized as anti-labour, damned as part of a larger ‘neo-liberal’ scheme, and opposed by the large trade unions that draw their membership mainly from the existing organized sector. No reformist government has had the courage to break this particular egg to make the desired omelette, i.e., rapid growth of productive employment. All of them have been happy to step gingerly around the issue or, as in the case of the Modi government, to pass the buck to state governments, most of which (to no one’s surprise) have focused on other matters.
Politicians’ Compulsions
Meanwhile, the political class has its own concerns. Elections cost money, many million rupees to contest a state legislature seat, and hundreds of millions for some parliamentary seats; a typical parliamentary constituency has 1.4 million voters. Almost all of the cash used to fight an election is unaccounted money, contributed either by the political party or garnered by the candidate. The money has to come from somewhere, either extracted from businessmen who pay for favours from the government, or siphoned off in cash from government-spending programmes. That is one reason why about half the grain supplied by the government at subsidized rates does not reach its intended beneficiaries (the poor); why in public-sector oil-marketing companies the adulteration of diesel with lower-priced kerosene is an organized racket; why billions of rupees spent on irrigation projects create no additional irrigation capacity, as corrupt contractors first bribe ministers and then cheat on the work to be done; and why government-owned banks have financed highway projects at (on average) twice the cost assessed by the National Highway Authority of India. Business favours can take many forms: of getting government-owned electricity-generating units to back down so that the power-distribution companies have to turn to higher-priced power that is privately generated; of high tariffs imposed on steel imports so that domestic producers improve profit margins; of radio spectrum sold well below the market price to favoured mobile telephone companies; of government-owned airlines vacating profitable flight routes and time slots, which are quickly allotted to private airlines.
  These are not deals and scandals carefully hidden in cupboards, along with other skeletons; indeed, they are the stuff of political allegations hurled across the floor in Parliament and state legislatures, and of committee reports and inquiry findings. Much of it, therefore, is common knowledge. The colour of political money taints government decisions, puffs up project costs and leads to suboptimal outcomes in every conceivable way. Political money is the canker that infects much of government functioning. It comes in the way of decisions to reduce the role of government, to privatize, to remove counterproductive controls and expand the role of markets, i.e., the very stuff of reforms.
  Naturally, politics is only nominally about ideology or maximizing welfare. While Indian politics has retained the formal structures of Westminster democracy, its substance harks back increasingly to older, more indigenous, traditions and practices. Other than the Bharatiya Janata Party, which is Hindu revivalist, and the communist parties, which are programme-driven, every other party in India’s multihued political spectrum has become the extension of a single politician or political family—starting, of course, with the Congress. Even parties that started out with clear ideologies, such as the socialists, and those that represented subnational identities have tended to become dominated by single families. This is feudalism in Westminster raiment, with some leading political families counting in their fold parliamentarians and state legislators who are into the third or fourth generation—the Congress’s Nehru–Gandhis, the Thackerays of the Shiv Sena, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam’s (DMK’s) Karunanidhi–Maran clan, the Scindias and others. Some political dynasties have emerged in surprisingly little time with billions of rupees in private wealth (such as Jaganmohan Reddy, son of a former Congress chief minister). Many politicians have diversified their activities and become wealthy businessmen in their own right—nascent Indian oligarchs, if you will, since their political clout is useful for business. Some, such as the Marans and the aforementioned Jaganmohan Reddy, have become media barons too. Indeed, individual parliamentarians have declared assets that outdo the entire British Cabinet. It is impossible to understand the political economy of India’s reforms, its limited scope and ambitions, without first understanding the reality of Indian party politics, the dynasties at its heart, and how the feudals have made the state their handmaiden. India’s politicians make sure that they extract their pound of flesh from the economy.
Broad Support for Shallow Reform
This political feudalism is mated to a modern sector of the economy and a growing middle class that apply counter-pressure points. Industry and trade have to function, and some semblance of law and order has to be maintained. The English-language media, including business publications, call for more market-oriented reforms, while the cleaner elements in the business world look for an end to corruption and cronyism. Civil-society organizations work at the grass roots to expose malfeasance and misfeasance, and the courts are independent. At the same time, urbanization reduces the role of caste- and community-oriented identity politics, because city dwellers tend to be more interested in issues such as clean air and proper water supply and, therefore, are less likely to simply vote according to their caste or community markers. The result of the interplay of these different forces is the stop-go, piecemeal, partial reform that India has seen since 1991.
  Where reform has been more comprehensive, it is because even though the changes faced resistance in political circles where old ways of thinking persisted, such resistance had no political resonance with voters. The sweeping industrial reforms of 1991 that ended most of the curbs on investment were welcomed in the circles that were affected because it had become increasingly obvious that the old controls were counterproductive. Slow change had begun a few years earlier, building up to the comprehensive delicensing of 1991 that became possible in an atmosphere of crisis management. Similarly, the steady dropping of income-tax rates was popular among taxpayers, even as the progressive reform of the indirect tax system (fewer tax rates, then a shift to value-added taxation) made life easier for businesses across the board.
  It is not that there was no resistance to change—many in the ruling Congress party were critical of the deviations from past orthodoxies. But the fact that there was no broader political resistance to the changes became evident when, in the 1996 elections, the reforms did not figure as an issue; they had not yet touched the lives of enough people. Even eight years later, in 2004, when the ruling BJP campaigned on the basis of a ‘Shining India’, it was rejected by voters who found the rival Congress focus on the ‘aam aadmi’ (common man) more convincing. The benefits of reforms were still to percolate deep enough to win votes.
  In economic terms, though, the freeing up of the private sector laid the foundation for faster economic growth. Private corporate profits as a share of GDP doubled to 8 per cent between the 1990s and the first decade of the new century. As a consequence, the ratio of fixed-capital formation to GDP surged from a range-bound 20–23 per cent of GDP in the 1980s and 1990s, to more than 30 per cent in the new century, taking up with it the rate of economic growth.
  Still, the reforms have remained partial, influenced to varying degrees by the existence of different interest groups, leading to the wisecrack that India has a ‘broad consensus for shallow reform’. Domestic businesses do not want a completely open economy that allows unbridled competition from foreign players, and this is one reason why average tariff levels, though much lower than before, remain higher than in most other countries. Upper-caste and middle-class interests speak to greater investment in university rather than government-school education; neglect of the latter affects mostly the poor, since wealthier parents turn to private schools. Organized labour, occupying high-wage islands, does not want the reform of labour laws that will take away some of their protections and privileges. And landed interests want a continuation of the inefficiencies that reside in the electricity and fertilizer subsidies, and state-guaranteed procurement of grain, since they are the primary beneficiaries of the largesse. In poorly administered cities, public transport suffers from relative neglect, while the small minority that commutes in cars occupies the bulk of available road space.
  There remains, even now, plenty of scope for reforms that don’t need to break the egg. Technology presents one set of options: the digitization of land records gives citizens access to them without the mediation of officials who hold out greasy palms; a biometric identity system makes it possible to replace clumsy subsidy programmes with better-targeted cash transfers. The scope for reforms also expands with the proliferation of success stories: no one would have failed to notice how much better the new private airports are than their government-run predecessors, with the ones in Delhi and Mumbai routinely featuring in the lists of the best-run airports around the world. A similar reform may now be attempted at the country’s major railway stations, a more demanding task since these are used by millions every day.
  Then, new institutions of governance are being created, such as the Competition Commission, autonomous regulators who set the rules for different business sectors (such as telecom or insurance), and the National Stock Exchange that has displaced the older, broker-dominated Bombay Stock Exchange, which reformed in the face of competitive pressure. Tax policies have been streamlined and modernized; while change is not complete, the system is unrecognizable from what existed in 1991—as is financial-sector regulation. The greater role played by overseas investors, portfolio as well as direct investment, has created its own pressure points for better governance, including in the corporate sector. The growing roles of international arbitration and of bilateral investment treaties have acted as restraints on arbitrary authority; notable exceptions tend to hit the headlines and create their own pressures.
Good, but Not Good Enough
In a way, all this explains the nature, scope and limitations of India’s quarter-century record of incremental reforms. They have seemed slow and inadequate at any particular point of time, but in their totality, they have had a significant cumulative impact. As is said, a photograph of India taken at any moment in time shows a messy picture; but over time, a moving picture shows how much has changed. The lowest-hanging fruit were plucked in 1991–93, but there has been a real, though unspectacular, broadening and deepening of reforms since then: the generation of greater surpluses leading to the slow cranking up of investment in (among other things) physical infrastructure; the steady improvement in health indicators; the expansion of the social-safety net through the employment-guarantee programme and government-provided medical insurance; and the sharp increase in enrolment rates for higher education. All this and more has led to the higher economic growth rates of the last couple of decades, with an annual average of 7 per cent since 1994.
  While creditable, this is short of the 8–10 per cent that was achieved in the rapid-growth phases of East Asian countries such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and China, and points to what a less incomplete reform might have achieved by now. If the growth rate had averaged 9 per cent over twenty years, per capita income would have been 45 per cent higher, with a consequential improvement in the employment situation, a sharp reduction in the numbers of the poor and better human-development indicators.
  The truth, therefore, is that the pace of reform has not been fast enough. India’s fundamental challenges are to create the millions of jobs each year that will keep its burgeoning population of working-age youngsters productively engaged, and to hold out for them the promise of a better future. These call for a still higher rate of economic growth, a much better quality of governance, a rapid end to extreme poverty, political decisiveness and a readiness for change that in their entirety are unlikely to materialize in the given circumstances of the country’s political economy. The multiple realities of its political economy mean that India’s reformers will continue to wrestle with the art of the possible, in an environment of suboptimality, even as it probably continues for the foreseeable future to be the world’s fastest-growing large economy.

India’s Entry into the Global Economy1
Martin Wolf
‘Just as the world accommodated the rejuvenation of Europe in the post-War world, it must now accommodate the rise of new Asian economies in the years that lie ahead.’
—Manmohan Singh, December 2006.2
India has re-entered the world economy. The foreign-currency crisis in 1991 created an opportunity for a transformation in India’s economic engagement with the world. By that time, many policymakers had realized that such a transformation was imperative. Nevertheless, someone had to bring it about. Those heroes were Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, and Manmohan Singh, his finance minister. These men launched reforms that began a transformation not only of economic policy, but, more important, of the policy consensus. Since then, India has moved, without reversals, from the plan to the market and from shrinking from the world economy towards embracing it.
  Twenty-five years later, what has changed in India’s role in the world economy? How far has it liberalized its barriers to trade and capital flows? Has the liberalization been a success? Finally, how should India approach the challenges likely to be posed by the world economy to itself—and by it to the world economy—over the next quarter of a century? These are the questions addressed below. India has indeed entered the world economy. Its own economy has also become far more open than ever before. But the challenges it confronts in the international economy are sure to increase, particularly if, as one hopes, its economic growth exceeds those of most other economies. This will be particularly true if many other countries become increasingly protectionist, as seems likely, particularly after the election of Donald Trump as president of the US. Increasingly, India will have to play a leading role in shaping the global economy and economic system.
A View from the 1970s
In 1982, The World Bank published my first book, India’s Exports.3 This was the delayed and much-revised product of the work carried out while I served as the senior economist in the Bank’s India Division from the autumn of 1974 to the summer of 1977. At that time, I focused my attention on India’s trade policies. Even considering liberalization of capital flows would have seemed a waste of time. Moreover, the Bank had a long-standing concern over the impact of India’s trade policy on the country’s rate of growth and pattern of development. The oil shock of late 1974 had brought these long-term concerns into sharper focus, since it created an immediate crisis in the balance of payments. Yet the long-term failures of the Indian economy were a still-greater anxiety. India’s decision to pursue an inward-looking development path since Independence had proved costly. The symptoms were inadequate growth and chronic shortages of foreign currency, even during good times. The crisis of the mid-1970s merely re-emphasized these failings.
  The seminal work of Jagdish Bhagwati and Padma Desai, published in 1970, had made clear to open-minded readers how necessary a decisive change in policy had become.4 My modest study was rather in the tradition of another seminal work, an analysis of Indian export performance by Manmohan Singh, subsequently finance minister and prime minister, published in the early 1960s.5 That study had marked the first important attempt to challenge export pessimism, which had ruled policymaking in the early years after Independence. The picture of India I was able to draw was of a country that had withdrawn still further to the margins of the world economy. ‘Thus, in the 1950s’, I noted, ‘India had been the foremost exporter of manufactures among the developing countries. By the middle of the 1960s it was second, by 1970 it was third, and by 1978 seventh. In 1978 the Republic of Korea’s manufactured exports exceeded India’s by 200 per cent.’6 Largely, as a result of this weakness in exports of manufactures, India’s share in world exports had fallen from 2.4 per cent in 1948 to a mere 0.4 per cent in 1979. In 1955, India’s manufacturing sector had been the eighth-largest among all market economies and much the largest among developing countries, with the exception of China. By 1976, its global rank had slipped to fifteenth. By creeping to the margins of the world economy, India had failed to take advantage of the great opportunity to accelerate industrialization through the promotion of exports of labour-intensive manufactures.
  When one raised the costs of this glaring failure with Indian policy intellectuals and policymakers in the mid-1970s, one was told that the progress of South Korea or Taiwan had no implications for such a vast country. Subsequently, China’s sensational rise as an exporter of manufactures destroyed such complacency. So, too, did the collapse of the Soviet Union. By the early 1990s, the inward-looking and notionally planned economy that India had created had become intellectually indefensible. Attachment to an inefficient development model had deprived the country of decades of lost growth. Every cloud has a silver lining: the crisis of 1991—a great shock at the time—was to mark a decisive and welcome change. Policy was transformed: India re-entered the world economy it had left decades before.
India Joins the World Economy
So, what has happened? Let us distinguish trade from movements of capital and labour, with the first being the most important.
1. Trade
By 2014, India’s share in world merchandise exports had risen to 1.7 per cent of the global total, just over four times its share in the 1970s and nearly as high as in 1948.7 India’s share in world exports of commercial services was higher than its share in world merchandise exports, at 3.2 per cent. This marked a decisive turnaround. Yet, the global significance of India as a trading power must be kept in context. Including internal trade within the EU, India ranked only nineteenth in world exports of manufactures in 2014. Excluding EU-internal trade, it ranked thirteenth. India had become substantially more significant in global exports of commercial services, however, at eight overall and fifth after excluding intra-EU trade. Noteworthy components of these exports of services have been information technology and business-process outsourcing; net exports in these sectors rose from negligible levels in 1990 to 25 per cent of India’s total exports in 2012.8
  To put this performance in context, China’s share in world merchandise exports reached 12.3 per cent in 2014. By then, the East Asian giant was the world’s largest merchandise exporter, whether or not internal EU trade was excluded. China was a more significant exporter of commercial services than India, ranking fifth if intra-EU trade were included and third if it were excluded. Evidently, India’s impact on world trade has remained far smaller than that of China.
  The opening of the Indian economy, measured in terms of the ratios of trade to output, is, however, noteworthy. In 1990, the ratio of exports to GDP was 7 per cent. By 2014, it had reached 25 per cent, before falling to 21 per cent in 2015. Meanwhile, China’s exports reached an astonishingly high level of 36 per cent of GDP in 2006. But this had fallen back to 22 per cent in 2015, much the same ratio as India’s (see Chart 1). Big countries tend to have less trade relative to GDP than smaller ones. But India and China both have more trade relative to GDP than would be expected, given the two countries’ sizes.9
 
  Chart 1: Exports of Goods and Services over Gross Domestic Product (Per Cent)
 
While India’s exports now account for much the same share of world exports as at the time of Independence, the ratio of its exports to GDP is now much higher than ever before. This is largely the product of the global opening to trade since the late-1940s. Ratios of trade to GDP have risen almost universally, as a result of the post-war trade liberalization of the high-income countries and the subsequent liberalization of most of the world’s economies in ‘the era of globalization’, from the late-1970s. In 1950, India’s ratio of exports of goods and services to GDP was only 8.4 per cent, little higher than in 1990.10 Between 1950 and 1990, therefore, India’s exports grew roughly in line with GDP. Since then, however, exports have grown far faster than GDP, which was itself growing substantially faster than world GDP, though not as much so as China’s. The fact that the cumulative growth of the Chinese economy was far faster than that of India explains why China’s role in world trade is far bigger than India’s, even though the Indian economy is now roughly as open to trade as China’s.
2. Capital and the Balance of Payments
The opening of trade is not the only transformation. Also important has been the increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) and portfolio equity, in both directions. In some ways, this indicates a more profound change in attitude than the opening of trade, given the hold of ‘East India Company syndrome’—the tendency to view all inward investors as Trojan horses—upon the minds of politicians and policymakers.11 Yet, while these anxieties have not altogether disappeared, they have diminished, partly no doubt because of India’s own outward investments, such as Tata’s acquisitions of Corus and Jaguar Land Rover in the UK.12 As India spawns its own multinational companies, it becomes increasingly difficult, both intellectually and politically, to spurn inward investors.
  India’s stock of inward FDI jumped from a mere 1.5 per cent of GDP in 1995 to 14 per cent of GDP in 2015. The stock of outward investment rose from negligible levels to 7 per cent of GDP over the same period. Relative to GDP, India’s inward and outward stocks of FDI in India are now as large as those of China (see Chart 2). Yet, once again, the difference in the growth of the two economies means that China’s FDI is far more significant globally, in both directions (see Chart 3). In 2015, for example, India’s outward FDI was just 0.6 per cent of the global stock, while China’s had reached 4.0 per cent of the total. Similarly, India accounted for just 1.1 per cent of the global inward stock, while China already accounted for 4.9 per cent. Both countries are substantially more important as destinations for greenfield investment than they are as recipients of FDI overall: India even received a slightly larger share of global announced inward greenfield investment in 2015 than China, though it was far less important than China as a source (see Chart 4). Meanwhile, though India became a far more important source and recipient of FDI, it has become almost entirely independent of the foreign aid that had mattered so much during the 1960s and 1970s.

India has run a current-account deficit almost consistently (see Chart 5). Thus, unlike mercantilist China, India has been a net importer of capital in recent decades. This is modestly helpful for macroeconomic balance in the world economy: fast-growing emerging economies should be net importers of capital from slower-growing high-income ones. India has also been able to accumulate foreign-exchange reserves—even though it has a floating exchange rate—through modest amounts of currency intervention. Its reserves reached $367 billion in August 2016, nearly an order of magnitude smaller than China’s, but a source of security, all the same.13 Thus, the old days of carefully rationed foreign exchange and tight controls on imports have been replaced by a current account that operates largely in accordance with market principles. A brief period of turmoil in 2013 was managed easily enough: the days of currency crises finally seem to be over.14
3. Labour
India is not a significant importer of labour. But it has become an important exporter. There have been substantial outflows of unskilled and semi-skilled temporary workers to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Oman. There have also been very large outflows of skilled labour, particularly to the US. ‘The Indian-born population in the U.S. grew from around 12,000 in 1960 to 51,000 in 1970. It then climbed to 206,000 in 1980, 450,000 in 1990, 1 million in 2000 and 3.2 million in 2010.’15

4. Conclusion
India has a much bigger presence in the world economy than it did a quarter of a century ago. But it is not yet in the category of the great global economic powers. In 2016, India’s nominal GDP should be the world’s seventh largest, between those of France and Italy, though it should be third when measured at purchasing-power parity.16 In 2015, India’s merchandise exports totalled $267 billion, against China’s exports of $2275 billion, EU external exports of $1985 billion and US exports of $1505 billion. Even in commercial services, India’s exports were only $155 billion, against EU external exports of $915 billion, US exports of $690 billion and Chinese exports of $285 billion.17 Again, in 2015, the stock of India’s inward FDI was $282 billion, against China’s $1221 billion and the world’s $24,983 billion. The stock of India’s outward FDI in the same year was only $139 billion, against China’s $1010 billion. India is still a second-tier player in the world economy, but one with the potential to become far more than that over the next quarter of a century. It is rising, but has not yet risen.
Evolution of Policy
India, it is clear, has a far more open economy than it did about a quarter of a century ago. What policies did it adopt to bring about this outcome and how much room for further liberalization does India have?
1. Trade Policy
India’s tariffs were nigh-on prohibitive before 1991. A wall of complex non-tariff barriers reinforced these barriers. As a result, imports were a mere 8 per cent of GDP in 1990. Arvind Subramaniam, chief economic adviser to the Indian government, summarizes the situation as follows: ‘Tariffs were stratospherically high – in absolute terms and relative to the rest of the world – prior to 1991 but have declined dramatically. They are close to 10 per cent today and have almost converged with tariffs in the rest of the world.’18 Yet, while non-tariff barriers have been liberalized, they remain extremely high. Mr Subramanian notes that ‘first, India’s overall barriers in services … are among the highest in the world (surpassed only by Zimbabwe)’ and are four to five times higher than in members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development; and ‘second, they are also very high for India’s level of development’.19 Measurement of non-tariff barriers is always difficult. But the plausible conclusion is that India’s manufacturing is relatively lightly protected, while the services sector is highly protected. According to Mr Subramanian, this treatment of services results ‘in an overall trade regime that is quite protectionist’.20
  This picture for trade policy creates what Mr Subramanian describes as a ‘paradox’. While India’s trade regime is quite restrictive, particularly in services, ratios of imports and exports to GDP are both high for such a big country. This suggests that the barriers are not as restrictive as one might expect.
  Nevertheless, room for substantial further liberalization certainly exists. This is true even for tariffs. One opportunity, for example, is to lower bound tariffs towards those actually applied. According to the European Commission, ‘India has generally bound its tariffs at levels of 25 to 40 per cent’.21 This is a substantial multiple of the average applied tariff. That gives the Indian government the ability to raise tariffs substantially, without any need to compensate trading partners. But it also makes continuation of the low-tariff regime relatively uncertain. The explanation for this circumspection is traditionally Indian—the desire to maintain as much policy space as possible alongside residual suspicion of the outside world.
  Indeed, India has played a consistently defensive role in global trade negotiations. In the 1970s, it was one of chief protagonists of the principle of ‘special and differential treatment’ of developing countries with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the precursor of the World Trade Organization (WTO). ‘Again, after the WTO came into being in 1994, it played a major role in preventing a broadening of the trade agenda to cover “behind the border issues” such as government procurement, competition and investment.’22 India, finally, played a significant role in preventing agreement in the Doha round of multilateral trade negotiations.23
  India has been no less circumspect in pursuing regional and preferential trade agreements. These have sprouted in recent decades, partly because of the difficulty of completing global agreements. Indeed, the Bali accord of 2013, which merely covered trade facilitation, was the first to be reached within the WTO since the turn of the millennium.24 The number of regional trade agreements notified to the GATT and then WTO and in force jumped from seventy in 1990 to 423 in 2016, with many more currently under negotiation.25 As of October 2016, the Department of Commerce of the Government of India lists nineteen preferential and regional trade agreements in which the country is ‘engaged’.26 Meanwhile, India played no role in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which included Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the US and Vietnam, but, notably, not Chin). It is, however, a part of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which includes the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) plus Australia, China, India, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand. The TPP had been signed under Barack Obama, but not ratified, which made it simple for Donald Trump to repudiate it upon taking office.27 The RCEP is not yet agreed upon. So far, the preferential agreements India has made have amounted to very little. This is unlikely to change without a fundamental alteration in India’s attitude towards trade negotiations, which is to consider it almost a matter of honour to concede as little as possible, if not less than that.
2. Policy towards Capital and the Balance of Payments
The Indian government has slowly opened the capital account, but far from completely. The FDI policy regime has shifted from a positive to a negative list: what is not forbidden is permitted. Foreign investors can in principle invest in most sectors, with minimal government interference. Portfolio equity investment by foreign investors was liberalized quite early in the reform programme. Investment in government and corporate bonds has also been deregulated gradually.28 As the activities of India’s own multinational corporations abroad have become more noteworthy, so has the domestic resistance to inward FDI diminished.
  After the crisis of 1991, India devalued the rupee substantially and adopted a managed floating exchange rate, with full convertibility on current account.29 The Reserve Bank of India is, nevertheless, prepared to intervene in the market to limit short-term instability. With the adoption of a more formal system of inflation targeting in 2016, India’s management of monetary policy and the exchange rate has increasingly converged on the current norm in the advanced economies—a floating exchange rate, inflation targeting; a monetary policy committee; and operational independence for the central bank.30
  Yet, quite rightly, India, just like China, has been cautious about full liberalization of the capital account. In particular, debt inflows, especially inflows of short-term debt, have remained tightly curbed. Several instruments are used: quantitative limits, price-based measures and administrative measures. The aim has been to reduce the vulnerability of the balance of payments to instability. This has been successfully achieved, through both the Asian financial crisis of 1997–98 and the global financial crisis of 2007–09. It has been done by avoiding the build-up of volatile foreign debt, and by curbing the build-up of debt denominated in foreign currencies and so constraining currency mismatches, particularly in the banking sector.31 Similarly, restrictions on capital outflows have been lifted only partially and slowly. Given the immense costs of international financial crises, these cautious policies are fully justified for India.32 To buttress the caution on the capital account, India has adopted the Basel III rules on capital adequacy and leverage of banks. It also requires foreign banks to enter only as subsidiaries. All this, too, is very sensible. The world has, after all, had a potent recent reminder of the dangers caused by unstable banks.
3. Conclusion
India’s economy has not only become more open, it has also become increasingly liberalized. This is hardly surprising: liberalization and openness go together just like a horse and carriage. Yet, while converging on the liberal policy regimes of the advanced economies, India has not gone the whole way. Its barriers to trade are higher than those of advanced economies and even many emerging economies. It remains cautious about committing itself to low barriers to trade. The advanced economies might, given current protectionist pressures, revert to India’s current levels of trade protection. But that still seems unlikely. India has also moved towards a vastly more liberal foreign-exchange regime, with a floating exchange rate. But it retains controls on capital outflows and inflows of debt-creating capital, particularly short-term debt, for prudential reasons. This caution has been vindicated by the country’s success in avoiding much of the impact of global financial crises, though India is inevitably affected by global economic slowdowns and financial shocks.
Impact of India’s Opening Up
In his important book on India’s reforms, Oxford University’s Vijay Joshi stresses that India’s external opening has been associated with and surely—at least in part—caused the acceleration of Indian growth. Between 1960 and 1991, the trend growth of Indian GDP per head (at purchasing-power parity) was 3.2 per cent. This rose to 5.3 per cent between 1991 and 2016. China’s GDP per head grew faster still, at more than 7 per cent a year over the latter period. By 2016, China’s GDP per head was at least double that of India, despite having been much the same in the late 1970s (see Chart 6).

Yet, India did not fall behind China because it liberalized too much, but rather because it liberalized too late and too little. In particular, India largely failed to exploit the opportunities for accelerated expansion of exports of labour-intensive manufactures that were such an important feature of China’s—and, before China, other east Asian economies’—accelerated growth of manufacturing, of low-skill employment and of GDP. This failure substantially reduced the ‘inclusivity’ of Indian growth. But, Mr Joshi notes:
. . . the reason for this outcome can be traced to domestic policies. In practice, a host of domestic policy impediments—small-scale industry reservations, rigid labour laws, infrastructure deficiencies, lack of access to credit, weak human capital policies, and discouragement of FDI in labour-intensive industries—have suppressed the demand for low-skilled labour. (In contrast, the demand for skilled labour has risen, and with it the wage premium for skills, which is one reason why income inequality increased over this period.) … India’s inclusion deficit has domestic roots and cannot be blamed on globalisation.33
The abiding resistance to letting market forces create mass industrial employment is an enormous error for which ordinary Indians have paid a similarly enormous price in worsened opportunities.
  At the same time, despite the failure to achieve Chinese levels of performance, India’s actual and expected impact on the world has grown substantially. This not only has economic implications, but also political ones. India’s relationships with other countries are increasingly affected by the expanded weight of the country’s economic ties and the growing perception abroad that this gigantic country—soon to be the most populous country in the world—is set to play an ever-increasing global economic and political role. This gives India leverage. It also imposes responsibilities upon it. India’s GDP per head (at PPP) is still only about one-eighth of that of the US. Nevertheless, its vast size and economic potential give it substantial and rising global influence. I have described India as being, like China, a ‘premature superpower’: it is on the way to possessing the dimensions of a superpower without the level of development that was previously associated with that status. Balancing its development needs with that status will be one of India’s greatest challenges.
Prospects and Challenges
Assume that India’s economy grows at just 6 per cent a year on average over the next two-and-a-half decades, while the rest of the world grows at 3 per cent. Then India’s share of world GDP, at purchasing power-parity, would rise from around 7 per cent today (according to the International Monetary Fund) to 15 per cent, not far short of where China is currently. It would then be a big power by any standards, even if still a relatively poor country. It is easy to imagine that India could do relatively better than this. Moreover, if India’s trade rose at least in line with GDP, then its share in world commerce might also more than double. Again, the rise could be far bigger than that. Such outperformance, relative to the rest of the world, is not merely likely, but also highly desirable. This is the only way India could hope to eliminate the mass destitution that, despite recent successes, still plagues the country.
  It follows that the overriding interest of the country is to pursue policies that allow it to exploit the opportunities for greater trade, capital inflows and access to know-how that the world economy affords. No less must India pursue policies aimed at expanding those opportunities. As a huge country, it is not just an importer of the world order, but inevitably a creator of that order as well. Particularly at a time when the advanced countries of the West are increasingly doubtful of their historic role in the global economy, the rising giants of Asia—China first and foremost, but also increasingly India—will have to play an increasingly systemic role. The old days of resistance to demands made on India will no longer be sufficient. India will have to accept an increasingly hegemonic role, even if alongside other big powers.
1. Role in World Trade
As India’s trade grows, it is likely to shift the global terms of trade against itself, at least to some extent. That is not an argument against trade. It is merely a recognition that size matters: as the country grows, the marginal returns on trade are likely to fall. But that also means India needs to do what it can to open world markets, while, again as desirable, it opens its own. Indeed, the growing relative size of India’s market is going to give it growing clout in international trade negotiations.
  An important strategic question for India is whether it should seek to strengthen the western-created liberal trading order or to create something different. I would argue strongly for the former option. Indeed, if anything, India should seek to strengthen the multilateral system of the WTO against the growing tendency towards regional arrangements. This is not to preclude participation in the latter, particularly if that affords the opportunity for behind-the-border integration that could benefit a country with an expanding role in the global creation of intellectual property and the development of new multinational companies. Nevertheless, India must look towards the world as a whole for three mutually reinforcing reasons: first, its immediate region is not big enough to provide substantial opportunities; second, any region that might afford huge opportunities (Asia, Europe or the Americas) contains at least one, if not more, economic power sure to remain bigger than it would itself be for the next quarter of a century or so; and, finally, its trading interests are, because of its sheer size, bound to be global. If a country must operate globally and must, even if it operates regionally, deal with powers greater than itself, then the global approach should be the cornerstone of its trade policies. The global approach is the broadest and the one that gives the closest thing to an international rule of law in trade matters. At the global level, India should also always be able to find allies, even though it may also find negotiating partners as obstructive as it can sometimes be itself.
  The implication of this is that India should, if at all possible, play a constructive role in the WTO, including in further global negotiations. In truth, the obstacles to successful completion of mega-regional negotiations are not much smaller than those to global ones. But, as a matter of realism, it also makes sense to seek participation in regional negotiations that are likely to set the terms of international rules in important areas. Should the TPP be ratified, now very unlikely, India should seek to join. Yet, India does not need to wait for further global negotiations to liberalize. In many areas, it is still in India’s interests to liberalize its own barriers to trade, along with relevant domestic obstacles to the exploitation of opportunities to trade. In particular, as China’s comparative advantage in labour-intensive manufacturing diminishes, an opportunity has re-opened for India. It should try hard to seize it.
  In short, India should pursue trading opportunities through a judicious combination of unilateral and reciprocal liberalization, with the latter being pursued by both multilateral and plurilateral means. Throughout, India must also recognize its interest in maintaining and indeed strengthening the liberal trading order and its potential role in achieving this outcome. It must understand, too, that its interests are now increasingly broad, as its role as an exporter of complex services, as a developer and user of intellectual property, and as the home of important multinational companies grows. Particularly important for India is the freedom of movement of Indian people, which is needed to support its dynamic exports of services. Indeed, India has a particularly strong interest in liberalizing trade in services, more broadly. But to achieve this, it will also need to increase access to its own market for services.
2. Role in Global Capital Flows
As with trade, India is almost certain to become a more important recipient and source of capital over the next quarter of a century. It will also, for the same reason, become a more important player in creating and implementing the rules governing the global monetary and financial systems. And again, just as with trade, India needs to find a way to balance its own interests with reform of the global systems.
  So far as India’s own liberalization is concerned, further progress on current lines should be the aim. Flows of FDI and equity capital should be free, in both directions, subject to natural concerns about national security, domestic competition and areas of high political sensitivity. Investment in retail has been such a sensitive area. In truth, both domestic and foreign investment in large-scale retail outlets creates the same issues for the competitiveness of India’s small retailers.
  Yet, despite a general orientation towards liberalizing capital flows and the domestic financial system, policymakers must also be aware of risks. It is essential, for example, to ensure the soundness of the domestic financial system. One way to do so is to pursue the idea of ring-fencing retail from investment banking, as proposed by the Independent Commission on Banking in the UK.34 More broadly, India should adopt and possibly go beyond the Basel agenda for stability. Areas of particular attention should be capital and liquidity requirements, which should be raised above global minima.35 The soundness of Indian finance will also become significant for the world, since it is almost inevitable that at least a few Indian financial institutions will become global players. Similarly, foreign financial players will seek a sizeable presence in India’s growing markets. This will give India substantial influence on global rules. It should prepare itself now on how to use it.
  Equally important, policymakers must pay attention to risks of destabilizing capital flows. As they already know, the main risks are created by short-term debt, particularly if denominated in foreign currency and intermediated via the banking system. These issues will not go away. Yet, as time passes, the Indian economy is likely to begin to have the weight needed for the rupee to become a reserve currency. This would change the nature of the risks to domestic financial stability, but not their salience.
  If India does want the rupee to become a significant reserve currency, it would also have to consider eliminating all exchange controls. On balance, this choice should be avoided for as long as possible: the gains would be small against the risks. John Maynard Keynes famously wrote ‘let finance be primarily national’ in 1933, at the depth of the Great Depression.36 India should not go that far. But it should be consistently aware of the persistence of the dangers against which Keynes then warned the world—those of irresponsible and short-sighted international finance. The events of the last decade have not diminished the relevance of these concerns: on the contrary, they have reminded us brutally of their continued importance. It is now widely recognized that emerging and developing countries could do better with continued exchange controls—notwithstanding the difficulties they create—than with hasty and incautious liberalization.
3. Role in the Global Monetary System
Financial reform and liberalization are closely related to the operation of the global financial system. Imbalances in current and capital accounts, large-scale currency intervention, irresponsible financial deregulation and desperate monetary-policy experiments have combined to create enormous risks of financial instability. Part of the answer is strengthening the global financial system. But the other part is strengthening the international monetary system.
  Ideally, two things need to be achieved. The first is more powerful disciplines over countries that run chronic current-account surpluses. These are deflationary for the rest of the world economy. That, in turn, tends to lead to destabilizing monetary policies and financial crises in net-capital-importing countries. This then causes huge financial crises, as we saw across much of the western world in 2007–08 and then, more narrowly, within the Eurozone in 2009–12. Ideally, penalties should be imposed on chronic surplus countries, particularly on those that intervene massively in currency markets to keep their exchange rates down. As a deficit country, it would be in India’s interests to promote such a discussion, even though a successful outcome is depressingly unlikely, given the long history of unproductive debates on this topic. These go back to the interwar period and the Bretton Woods conference of 1944 that led to the creation of the International Monetary Fund.37
  The second concern is international liquidity. At present, the main source of emergency liquidity for emerging and developing countries is their own foreign-currency reserves. But building such reserves creates important difficulties: it gives emerging countries a strong incentive to accumulate reserves by intervening heavily in foreign-currency markets and running current-account surpluses; it provides countries that issue reserve currencies with seigniorage and, more important, an incentive to run irresponsible fiscal, monetary and financial policies; and it may still provide crisis-hit countries with inadequate liquidity in a crisis. Instead of self-insurance, it would be far better if there were more collective insurance. The IMF’s own resources are at present far too small to play such a role, particularly in a world of largely liberalized capital accounts. The Fund’s total resources amounted to roughly $1.3 trillion in October 2016.38 Meanwhile, total global foreign-currency reserves amounted to $11 trillion in July of the same year. Moreover, nearly all of the Fund’s resources involve conditionality, which imposes delay, quite apart from perceived humiliation. Another important source of temporary liquidity has been swap lines among significant central banks. But these swaps come at the discretion of those central banks and also are unavailable to most emerging economies. The best solution would be to allow the IMF to create large increases in so-called Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) in emergencies.39 India should argue for an amendment of the Fund’s articles to make this possible. As its role in this and other organizations increases, it could be a powerful voice for such reform.
  The other issue with the systems of international reserves is the continued dependence on national currencies. China’s determination to make the renminbi a reserve currency suggests that this will continue, but possibly even exacerbate instability. Certainly, a multiple-reserve currency could be even more unstable than one with a single dominant currency. The ideal answer would be to allow the IMF to create more reserves via the SDR. At present only about 4 per cent of total global reserves consist of SDRs. India, as a powerful and rising non-reserve-currency country could be an important voice for such a reform. To achieve this, it would need to change the current voting weights and super-majority voting requirements in the Fund.40 This is a worthwhile objective. But experience with recent attempt to change voting weights—particularly the huge difficulties in getting this ratified in Congress—shows that this is likely to be a an uphill fight.41
4. Role in Labour Flows
Remittances have become an important part of India’s balance of payments, growing from a mere $2.1 billion in 1990 to $66 billion in 2013.42 But, beyond this, India’s diaspora is a potent source of economic connections, know-how and international influence. This gives India a considerable interest in the immigration policies of western countries and those in the Persian Gulf. At the same time, India’s own economic development could be accelerated by the skills of foreigners. It should be extremely open to immigration of highly skilled foreigners. This would also make it easier to argue for such openness in foreign countries. Beyond this, there is a strong case for rules governing the treatment of migrants, both skilled and unskilled. As a source of both and a potentially important recipient, India should promote such a dialogue.
5. Other Challenges
These are far from the only global challenges confronting a rising India in the global economy. Perhaps the most important additional issue is climate change. That is far more than merely an economic issue. However, tackling climate change evidently involves both economic costs and consequences. As a poor country with relatively low emissions of greenhouse gases per head, India could reasonably feel it has no moral obligation to tackle a problem others have created. At the same time, Indians share the planet with everybody else. Moreover, as a large and rapidly growing country, India’s policy choices—not to mention the path of its emissions—will be of great importance. Finally, new energy technologies, notably solar power, provide important opportunities for India. For all these reasons, India will be compelled, willy-nilly, to play a big part in tackling the global challenge of climate change.
Conclusion
Some are born great; some achieve greatness and some have greatness thrust upon them. In the global economy, India is achieving greatness by virtue of its increased openness and relatively rapid growth and, as a result, has the demands of greatness thrust upon it. While far behind China, its weight in the world has substantially increased and will increase further. At the same time, its increased openness has created new opportunities and improved performance. The great gamble on openness and reform, from more than twenty-five years ago, has paid off. It has led to a new policy consensus and improved performance. Nevertheless, these are still very early days. India has a long way to go in further opening and, above all, domestic reform. It will also have a big and growing role to play in the global system as a whole.
  India must decide its interests and priorities. It seems clear that as a dynamic, increasingly open, market-oriented democracy, its interest lies in promoting a peaceful world that possesses an equitable, rules-governed global order, based on liberal principles. If India gives its growing strength to this cause, it will be doing well by doing good. But first, it must accept that it will need to become a leader, not just a beneficiary of what is today an increasingly enfeebled global system. Can India rise to this challenge? The next quarter of a century will provide the answer.

Trade-policy Reform in India Since 1991
Harsha Vardhana Singh1
An important part of the Indian experience with trade-policy reform since 1991 is that these changes were managed without major disruptive consequences despite the fact that India’s average tariffs are close to the world’s lowest tariff economies.
Introduction
In his 1991 Budget speech introducing a vast range of Indian economic reforms, Dr Manmohan Singh said:
As we enter the last decade of the 20th century, India stands at the crossroads. The decisions we take and do not take, at this juncture, will determine the shape of things to come for quite some time . . . But India’s future development depends crucially on how well the planning process is adapted to the needs of a fast changing situation.
For trade policy, these words ring as true today as they did twenty-five years ago, even though India has covered a long distance in the direction set out in 1991. India is once again at a crossroads, with global market conditions changing rapidly in a world where even the notion of international trade and trade policy is not what it was a couple of decades ago. Thus, trade-policy reform must be based on an evolving framework, which needs to be renewed and focused upon in the context of the times, bearing in mind both the conventional and new areas of trade policy.
  An important part of the Indian experience with trade-policy reform since 1991 is that these changes were managed without major disruptive consequences. The economy has been on a strong growth trend, though from time to time, there are concerns about its weaknesses, with even a revision of the direction of trade policy in certain sectors, such as electronics.
  In the last twenty years, global markets have changed in major ways, with increased competitive pressures resulting from larger participation of several developing economies in world trade (particularly, China). The rise in FDI stock has meant an increasing overlap between trade and investment, and a rise in the significance of international value chains, and lead firms managing those value chains to specify the conditions relevant for quality and social and sustainability standards. An important realization in the context of value chains is that imports contribute to exports. Recent data show that imported inputs contribute about one quarter of the total value of India’s exports.2
  The world of international trade and trade policy continues to evolve as the focus areas in trade policy are framed by new efforts to establish trade agreements, especially bilateral and regional trade agreements by some large economies.
  This implies a need for trade-policy reform to encompass both the likely changes in regional and global markets and the evolution of international trade policy in major economies. In this context, a quick look at the evolution of the scope of trade policy will help us better understand the range of trade policies currently relevant for policymakers and business.
(a) Evolution of Trade Policy
Earlier, trade policy focused mainly on border measures, such as tariffs, quotas, import licensing and prohibitions on imports. Some inside-the-border policies that were seen as impacting trade conditions, such as subsidies and local content requirements, were also part of the consideration. Over time, many more inside-the-border policies that affect trade began to be part of the trade-policy focus, such as IPR, trade-related investment measures, and a recognition that trade rules also needed to apply to services (including regulatory conditions). With increasing competition in global markets and larger economic presence of many developing economies, additional trade-policy considerations started emerging, which reflected an increasing focus in developed economies on conditions that they considered as necessary to create a ‘level playing field’ in world trade. These included policies that affect ‘competitive neutrality’, like differences in social and sustainability (labour and environment) standards, preferential support provided to state enterprise, competition policy, regulatory practices, and ‘responsible business conduct’. Rules or codes of conduct had to be agreed upon for ensuring that standards do not become trade barriers, thus leading to a focus on principles of good regulatory practice, the framework for regulatory coherence and emphasis on establishing a memorandum of understanding or processes for determining conformity among the standards used in different economies.
  World trade has been accompanied by an increase in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), which together with greater tradability of services, led to a rise in the prominence of international value chains in world trade. Effective and efficient value chains require quick response and turnover, with consistent good-quality products and reliable supply. This changed the focus of trade policy towards greater facilitation of processes and value chains, improving infrastructure, and on conditions of investment in other economies.
  The spread of digital services and their importance in trade have brought into trade-policy focus the rules for e-commerce, data transfer and certain IPR issues relevant to the digital realm. An interesting feature of the disaggregated value-chain component shows that a large part for many of the major products with a wide reach (e.g. the cell phone) is returns to technology and knowledge (IPRs). The new technologies that are emerging in several areas such as communications technology, material science, biotechnology and renewable energy are creating new technology-intensive ‘sunrise sectors’ in global markets. The emergence of new technologies and related ‘sunrise industries’ has meant greater emphasis on IPRs by owners of technology.
  Together with the growth of FDI and value chains, services markets too have opened up, encouraged by greater tradability of services, improved communications technology, and greater experience with generally accepted principles of ‘good regulation’. This has led to the recognition of a need to expand the concept of trade as applied to services (spanning Mode 1 to Mode 4 as agreed in WTO’s General Agreement on Trade in Services3).
  The rise of international value chains has also led to a recognition of the fact that a significant portion of value added in goods is due to services. This has led to new ways of identifying and collecting trade data on services trade. Recent data on trade in terms of value added have shown that the share of services in international trade is much higher than previous calculations because manufactured products also include value added from services.4 Value-added trade data show that the share of services in international trade is about 40 per cent, much more than previous estimates. As Lanz and Maurer explain: ‘Services account for more than 70% of world GDP but only for around 20% of world trade in balance of payments terms. In value added terms, accounting for services embodied in exported goods, services account for 40% of world trade.’5
  An important feature of services trade-policy reform is that it involves both opening up of market entry to new service providers, and creating a ‘level playing field’ for newcomers through a robust regulatory regime. This consequently established the importance of regulatory regimes as an integral part of the services trade policy.
  The enhanced role of value chains and larger links between goods, services and investment in trade have extended the scope of trade policy. There is a growing awareness of the importance of facilitation for international value chains, because consistency of standards and timely response are crucial for efficient operation of these chains.
  With several rounds of trade negotiations at the GATT/WTO, the incidence of tariffs and import quotas has come down, though they still remain a focus in trade negotiations. However, other, inside-the-border trade-related policies are now a much larger part of trade-policy considerations. This has implied not only that trade policies have a wider scope and coverage, but that they are now more controversial, as policies hitherto considered the complete domain of domestic policy are now part of trade-policy considerations, both globally and within India.
  While efforts within the WTO continue to evolve disciplines in new areas of trade policy, greater scope of trade-policy agreements can be witnessed through recent trade negotiations involving large economies. The implicit aim of these negotiations is to create trade-policy disciplines that would potentially apply more widely, and pave the way for common standards being applicable to their producers and markets.
  This paper discusses India’s trade-policy changes since the 1990s in many of the above-mentioned areas. We begin with a summary look at the economic situation since 1991 and then take a more detailed look at the main trade-policy developments in the country. The issues relating to tariffs and non-tariff measures are addressed in some detail, followed by trade facilitation and services. The paper concludes with a summary look at factors relevant to ongoing trade-policy concerns, such as international value chains, investment, social and sustainable standards, and some other policy areas likely to become significant in the near future.
1. Evolution of Some Key Economic Parameters since 1991
Table 1 shows that India’s experience in terms of the external sector has a number of positive achievements as well as some emerging concerns. Foreign-exchange reserves have increased and the current-account deficit is relatively low, but the trade deficit as a share of GDP has increased to very high levels. This results in the government focusing on the large increase in merchandise imports compared to exports, and on seeking ways that would limit the rise in imports and improve the country’s export performance.

Note: *2014; # The equivalence is in relation to imports of goods and services.
The overall improved economic performance shows that since 1991 India has, in general, managed positive economic achievement with limited disruptions that otherwise usually follow major economic reforms. Today, with its greater economic strength, India should be able to continue its process of reform to address the current situation in international trade.
2. Trade Policy: Many Types of Policies and Still Evolving
There is a whole range of trade policies that need to be considered for understanding comprehensively the evolution of Indian trade-policy reform (see Table 2). Furthermore, with potential new Free Trade Agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the issues covered in the context of trade policies is even more extensive.6

This paper will not cover each of these policies in detail. It will focus on some of the major trade-policy areas to show the direction of trade-policy change for India in the last twenty-five years, and, based on that, indicate some further steps needed in that context. The paper begins with the key features of trade-policy reform introduced in 1991. This reform addressed four different aspects of trade policy: tariffs, non-tariff measures, measures affecting exports, and institutions and procedures relating to trade. The paper takes a summary look at these trade-policy areas, and then discusses trade-policy reforms in the context of other areas such as services, whose importance in terms of trade-policy has grown in more recent times. This is followed by a discussion of the more current trade-policy concerns and the need to recognize that trade-policy initiatives are taking place in multiple ways, with a shift from formal and government-led initiatives to informal and more private-sector participation in determining the contours of trade-policy frameworks. This suggests a need for enlarging the scope of our trade-policy considerations and preparation to carry forward the momentum that was provided by the reform in 1991.
3. Trade-policy Reform in 1991
In 1991, India’s foreign-exchange reserves had plummeted to levels that would finance only a fortnight’s imports; the debt service burden was one-fifth of current-account receipts, fiscal deficit was above 8 per cent, leading to pressure on balance of payments; and the consumer price index had increased by 13.6 per cent with implications for changing the foreign-exchange rate. Those was dire times requiring major policy changes.7
  The 1991 Budget recognized the significance of trade-policy reform as part of the overall reform programme, stating, for instance: ‘The policies for industrial development are intimately related to policies for trade.’8
  A number of steps were taken to reform trade policy: a more outward-oriented regime was put in place; tariffs were reduced in a phased manner; import duties were streamlined or simplified; and a process transforming quantitative border restrictions to price-based measures was begun. Likewise, export incentives were continued or new ones provided for a number of products,9 and institutional changes were made to bring transparency and to facilitate transactions involving domestic and foreign markets. This included the establishment of certain institutions or revised mandate for existing institutions that would help implement the new focus areas (e.g. the Tariff Commission10).
  The 1991 Budget speech11 gives the main thrust of policy change as follows:
The time has come to expose Indian industry to competition from abroad in a phased manner. As a first step in this direction, the government has introduced changes in import export policy, aimed at a reduction of import licensing, vigorous export promotion and optimal import compression. The exchange rate adjustments on 1st and 3rd July 1991 and the enlargement and liberalization of the replenishment licence system constitute the two major initial steps in the direction of trade-policy reform. They represent the beginning of a transition from a regime of quantitative restrictions to a price based mechanism. (para 11)
The 1991 trade-policy reform was an exercise that balanced several objectives. For instance, loss of revenue was a major concern, and this was mentioned as a reason for not reducing the import duty more than what was being announced. In a number of instances, import tariffs were kept high to encourage infant industry. The need for protecting Indian industry against foreign competition, and to save foreign exchange, were explicitly recognized (paragraphs 10, 80 and 130 of the Budget speech). This was balanced with a reduction in tariffs to lower input costs and to encourage export activities.12 The Budget speech stated, for instance:
I have attempted to structure the proposals for customs and excise levies in a manner that indigenous industries are encouraged, and, at the same time, imports of items required for export production are not thwarted. In the long term, if revenues are buoyant and tax compliance improves, I expect to bring down the rates of customs and excise levies. Even now, some moderation in import duties is being attempted and a more broad-based effort may be attempted to streamline the structure and reduce the rates in the next Budget. I have also tried to ensure that the proposed changes improve competitiveness of the industrial sector, particularly the export oriented industries. (para 105)
  In the sphere of customs duties, over time, the objective of protection for infant industries and the need to raise revenues have led to a situation where import duties prescribed for certain items are inordinately high and, in several cases, more than 300 per cent. As a measure of reform, I propose to reduce the ad valorem rate of basic plus auxiliary duties of customs to a maximum of 150 per cent where it is more than that at present, thereby eliminating the tariff peaks above 150 per cent. The only exceptions that would remain hereafter are imported alcoholic beverages and passenger baggage. (para 107)
Interestingly, while a major part of the Budget was oriented towards reform, much of it was conventionally focusing on certain ongoing objectives emphasized by the government and promoted through the Budget, such as promoting technological upgradation, facilitating capital goods imports, keeping prices low for products such as essential drugs and certain machinery and equipment, improving the environment, promoting tourism by facilitating products that contribute to the value chain, and promoting software exports.
  Three interesting features emerge from the 1991 Budget. One, though the tariff levels were reduced, they were still kept at significantly high levels. Two, the trade-policy reform in 1991 was an initial step, which would be continued over time. Three, the nature and pace of reform would depend on the underlying economic factors, which were a matter of concern for the government. The trade-policy reforms were notified by the Five-Year EXIM Policy in 1992, which provided stability to the content and direction of change brought in by the 1991 reform.
  Another important feature of the 1991 reform was that it began opening up the regime for FDI. While FDI was not linked at that time with trade policy, it created a base for increasing economic linkages with global markets. We consider below how this objective of greater links with world markets was implemented through changes in tariffs and non-tariff measures.
4. Tariff Reform
The government established a committee under Raja Chelliah on tax reforms, to provide expert inputs for policy reform. In its final report in 1993, with respect to tariffs, the Chelliah Committee was of the view:
The very high or high rates applicable to most commodities, the multiplicity of statutory rates, the wide spread of rates and the continued issue of a large number of exemption or concessional rate notifications not only made the administration of the system extremely complicated, but led to unintended and undesirable effects on the allocation of resources in the economy . . . there is general agreement now that the import tariff system should be drastically simplified, the levels and spread of the rates of duty must be reduced significantly and as early as possible with the re-structuring of the duties, most of the notifications must be eliminated.13
The committee suggested seven different rates covering different product categories14 to be in place latest by March 1998.15 The committee recommended that India’s import-weighted duty rate come down to 25 per cent by March 1998. The government accepted the report and further tariff reform in India was based on these recommendations.16
  A clear enunciation of the various considerations that underlay India’s tariff reform initiation is contained in the Budget speech of 1993, and is very instructive to understand the reasoning behind those changes. The factors enunciated then, remain largely relevant even today in terms of such reform. Relevant excerpts from that speech are reproduced in Annex I to this paper.
(a) A Major Decrease in Tariffs over Time, Including Reducing Maximum Tariff Rates
Average tariff levels prior to 1991 were in triple digits, as shown by the 1990–91 estimates in Table 4. The 1991 tariff reform reduced these very significantly, but the new levels too were very high at the end of the 1990s. However, the downward trend in India’s tariffs continued for much of the period since 1991. Before 1991, the maximum tariff was 355 per cent. In the 1991 Budget, it was specified at 150 per cent, as shown by the text of paragraph 107 of the Budget speech quoted in Section 2 above.
  Table 3: India. Peak Tariff Rates Announced in the Budget Speeches since 1991
 
* This includes a 2 per cent special customs duty that was levied on ‘all imports except those that carry nil rate of duty or are imported at nil rate of customs duty for export production under the various duty-free licences’. (para 119, Budget speech, 1996–97).
** Includes 5 per cent surcharge imposed in September 1997, which was removed in the Budget of 1999–2000.
# Announced in January 2004.
Note: No change in peak rate since 2007. However, several individual tariff rates were reduced and in some cases increased every year.
The peak tariffs were reduced every year except for two during the period 1991–92 to 2007–08. The exceptional years were 1996–97 and 1998–99 (see Table 3). In the 1996–97 Budget, the peak rate was not reduced, and on top of that a special duty of 2 per cent (akin to a surcharge) was added, thus raising the maximum tariff rate. Similarly, in 1998–99, the previous year’s peak rate plus surcharge was not reduced.
  However, in both these Budgets, tariffs were reduced for a large number of products.17 While several tariffs were reduced, some items were also subjected to higher tariffs in line with the finance minister’s statements: ‘The gradual reduction of import duties in the past few years has resulted in certain distortions and anomalies. My proposals seek to correct them as far as found feasible without causing abrupt disruption in the duty structure.’18
  A noteworthy feature of India’s tariff peaks and averages in the early 1990s was that though they were reduced from high levels, they were high (particularly for non-agriculture) compared to most tariffs prevailing in economies with low tariffs, e.g. the United States.19
  In 1992–93, India’s maximum tariff rate was reduced to 110 per cent, with the exception of alcoholic beverages and baggage.20 This trend continued and the peak customs duty in India was brought down to 50 per cent in 1995–96. The reduction in peak tariffs continued again every year since 1999–2000 to reach 10 per cent in 2007–08 (see Table 3 and Annex II).
  Interestingly, in the early part of the previous decade, more than one finance minister signalled the intention to continue decreasing tariffs. The Budget speech in 2004 stated that India would continue to decrease its tariffs in a measured way, with the intention to align India’s tariff structure with that of ASEAN countries. This view was reiterated in 2005, the year when tariffs on 217 items covered under the WTO’s Information Technology Agreement (ITA) were reduced to zero.
  Two interesting features of the reduction in India’s peak tariffs are:
* these peak rates are not necessarily the maximum tariffs prevailing, but the highest rate for a large proportion of tariff lines (say, 70 per cent or more lines); and
* these rates do not apply to agricultural items.21
These two aspects are shown in certain parts of Annex II, when the finance ministers mentioned tariffs higher than the peak rate and also that the peak-rate reduction applies only to industrial products.
(b) Reduction in Tariffs Peaks Prepare India’s Pathway to being a Low-tariff Economy
The sustained focus on reducing tariff peaks has contributed to India moving towards being a low-tariff economy. Table 4 shows that as a result of the tariff changes introduced since the tariff reform in 1991, India’s simple average tariff in 2015–16 was about one-tenth of that in 1990–91.
  Table 4: India. Effective Simple Average Tariff, 1990–91 to 2014–15
(Per cent effective means basic applied tariff rate adjusted for exemptions)
 
Source: Trade Policy Reviews of India, Secretariat Reports (various years), WTO.
Notes: 1990–91 average tariffs are prior to tariff reform. The estimates include auxiliary duty mostly of 45 per cent. Auxiliary duty was the same as customs duty, i.e., it was an additional customs duty over and above the basic customs duty. Therefore, simplification of the basic customs-duty regime would have meant that duty to be merged with auxiliary duty. In the 1993–94 Budget, the auxiliary duty was merged with the basic custom duty (see Annex II).
On the basis of these estimates, with about 13 per cent simple average applied MFN (Most-Favoured Nation) tariffs, India today is close to the upper part of the range of tariffs in ASEAN economies.22 If we consider only the MFN tariffs, then it would appear that considerable further tariff reduction would be required if India aims to reach the middle part of the ASEAN tariff structure, with the average applied MFN tariffs of Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar and the Philippines ranging between 5.6 to 6.9 per cent.
  However, an important point to bear in mind is that though the tariff averages for India based on MFN tariffs and certain adjustments show relatively high tariffs, the actual applied average tariffs, which encompass all concessions and exemptions, are shown by estimating the customs tariffs per unit imports. We can see the difference between the usual estimates of tariffs and those based on customs duties from the information provided in Tables 4 and 5.
  Thus, if we alternatively consider the weighted average tariff based on customs revenues for India, the picture is very different. In terms of its weighted average tariff, India is already one of the low-tariff economies in the world.
(c) India: An Economy with Very Low Average Tariffs
Table 5 shows India’s trade-weighted tariff average, based on the customs revenue collected divided by corresponding year’s merchandise imports.
  Table 5: India. Total and Basic Customs Revenues as Percentage of Imports, 1990–91 to 2015–16
 
Source: Government of India.
Notes: The estimates are rounded up to the nearest one decimal digit.
# Prior to 1996–97, different components of revenue collection are not available and the total customs collection is given as basic duty in various Budget documents.
Table 5 shows two estimates relating to customs revenues as a proportion of import value in that year. ‘Total customs revenue’ includes both tariffs and the countervailing duties (CVD) on imports, the latter being imposed on imports in lieu of domestic excise tax. ‘Basic customs revenue’ shows the revenue from only tariffs, i.e., it excludes revenues due to CVD (see section (h) below for discussion of CVD). To examine the average level for tariffs alone, we should consider the estimates based on basic customs revenues.
  We can see that after 1991, a large fall in weighted average applied tariffs (without CVD) took place till end 1990s, reaching about 13 per cent of a tariff level of almost 50 per cent. From 2005–06 onwards, India’s average tariffs based on total customs duties collected was mostly in single digits; average tariffs in terms of basic customs duties were in single digits from 2002–03 itself. It is noteworthy that the average customs duty corrected for CVD is below 2 per cent in the years from 2012–13 to 2014–15.23
  The difference between CVD and actual tariff rates started increasing in the late 1990s and has continued till today, showing a preponderance of CVD in total customs duties of India.
  It should be noted that the estimates of tariffs given in other Tables are not strictly comparable to those calculated based on customs revenue shown in Table 5. The other tariff estimates are based on MFN tariffs or adjustments made to the MFN tariffs for concessions. The estimates in Table 5 are a composite estimate taking into account all aspects of concessions in an aggregate way.
  The customs-revenue–based weighted average tariff for the US is 1.5 per cent, computed on the basis of dividing the US customs revenue by its merchandise imports.24 The estimate for India is not too different from that of the US, which is one of the low average-tariff economies.
  This shows that India is far more open than what has normally been perceived till now, in terms of tariffs.
(d) Does the Picture Change Due to a Downward Bias of Trade-weighted Average Tariff?
The weighted average tariff estimates in Table 5 are downward biased because of relatively lower imports of products with higher tariffs. This estimate does, nonetheless, provide a reasonable indication of the overall qualitative low tariff level, particularly if most of the tariff lines are in the lower range of tariffs. This is the situation for India, which has a large share of its tariff lines with low tariffs.
  Table 6 shows that 13 per cent of agriculture tariff lines and 90 per cent of non-agriculture tariff lines are with tariffs of 10 per cent or below.25 Internationally, most of the focus of tariff liberalization is towards non-agriculture products, which in India’s case have an overwhelming share of their tariffs between 0 and 10 per cent. For example, even within the TPP, immediate tariff elimination applied only to 70 per cent (Vietnam) to 100 per cent (Singapore) of non-agriculture tariff lines, but in the case of agriculture tariff lines, this ratio was 42.6 (Vietnam) to 100 (Singapore) per cent; in the case of Japan and the US, immediate elimination under TPP was agreed only for, respectively, 51.3 and 55.5 per cent of their agriculture tariff lines.26
  Annex Table 1 shows the relatively few non-agriculture tariff lines in India that are above 10 per cent. Annex Table 2 suggests that most of these non-agricultural products with tariffs above 10 per cent are not likely to be among the major traded items for India. We see from Annex Table 2 that the overall import share of non-agricultural products with tariffs above 10 per cent in total imports is 4.54 per cent. Of these, iron and steel and articles of iron and steel (HS categories 72 and 73, with tariff of 15 per cent) account for 3.93 per cent. The rest of the products account for only about 0.6 per cent of total imports. The combined impact of a reduction in tariffs for these items and the consequent rise in their imports is unlikely to contribute to a significant increase in India’s weighted average tariff.27
  Therefore, it would be reasonable to consider that the low average-weighted tariff shown in Table 5 gives a reasonably correct message about India’s effective tariffs, namely that on average, India is a low-tariff economy similar to some of the developed economies that are seen as more open in terms of their low tariffs.
  An important message from this estimate is that we need to revise the general impression that average tariffs in India are significantly higher compared to those in other large countries. The average tariffs of India are close to those prevailing amongst the economies, which are considered to be the lowest-tariff economies.
(e) India: Different Tariff Patterns for Agriculture and Non-Agriculture Products
The profile of tariff distribution across agriculture and non-agriculture products (see Table 6) show the greater tariff protection provided by India to its agriculture. This is not unusual, as can be seen for several developed economies as well, including the United States and very much the EU.28 India’s agriculture tariffs were affected by two very important events at the WTO, one that increased the extent of tariffs and another that reduced them.
  The first was the fact that under the Uruguay Round results, all non-tariff measures of agriculture, for all WTO members, were converted into tariffs. The WTO Agreement allowed this for certain developing countries (including India) under the so-called ‘ceiling binding’ scheme under the Agreement on Agriculture concluded in the Uruguay Round.29 This implied that the prevailing tariffs for agriculture in India were increased at the end of the Uruguay Round to replace the prevailing quantitative restrictions by tariffs.
  The second was a significant development that led to a further liberalization of India’s tariff and non-tariff regime, namely, the balance of payments (BOP) related dispute, which India lost at the WTO. The loss in that dispute meant India did not have the possibility to claim under WTO that it was entitled to implement higher trade restrictions than those allowed in WTO under normal circumstances, on the grounds that it faced a BOP problem.30 Though the focus of the dispute brought by the United States was on quantitative restrictions, it also led to a reduction in a number of tariffs.31 This added to the momentum of changes brought about through a general emphasis on reducing tariffs by successive finance ministers.
  The combination of the ‘ceiling binding’ and concern to provide high-tariff protection to agriculture has led to relatively higher tariffs for these products compared to non-agriculture ones.
  Thus, a closer look at India’s tariff structure shows that India’s overall average tariffs are low primarily because of the low tariffs for non-agricultural products and their large share in total imports (see Table 6). The weighted average tariff for agriculture is increased32 both due to a preponderance of significant share of agricultural tariff lines with higher tariffs and the larger share of imports subject to these higher tariffs (see Table 6).
  Table 6: India. MFN Tariffs for Agriculture and Non-Agriculture (2015) and Import Shares (2014) for Different Tariff Ranges (Percentage)
 
Source: World Tariff Profiles 2016, WTO, ITC and UNCTAD, 2016, 96.
Note: For current high tariffs for non-industrial products, see Annex Tables 1 and 2. For detailed tariffs for each tariff line, see http://www.cbec.gov.in/htdocs-cbec/customs/cs-tariff2015-16/cst2015-16-idx.
These estimates show that the conventional view that India is a high-tariff economy is incorrect even for most tariff lines with MFN tariffs. The tariff estimates in Table 6 suggest that Indian MFN average tariffs for non-agriculture products too are likely to be close to that of economies that are considered very open in terms of their tariff regime.
(f) Comparison of India’s Average MFN Tariffs with Tariffs of APEC Economies
Based on the information in Table 6, we compare India’s weighted average MFN tariff for agriculture and non-agricultural products, with those of APEC economies (see Table 7). An interesting picture emerges here. India’s non-agricultural tariffs are close to certain APEC economies, and is in fact less than the average for some APEC economies (Chile, Russia and Vietnam). In contrast, India’s average agriculture tariffs are higher than all APEC economies, except for Republic of Korea. Therefore, even for MFN tariffs, India’s tariffs are within the range covered by APEC economies.
  Table 7: Trade Weighted Average MFN Tariff of India and APEC Members for Agriculture and Non-Agriculture Products (Percentage)
 
Source: WTO, ITC and UNCTAD, ‘World Tariff Profiles 2016’, WTO, Geneva.
Note: These estimates for India are higher than the tariff average based on basic customs revenue, because the former is based on MFN tariffs and while the latter takes account of all exemptions.
This shows us that India has travelled a long way from the days when tariff reform was initiated in 1991. Today, its level of average MFN tariffs for non-agriculture are comparable to several economies that are conventionally considered to have carried out significant tariff reform and opening up of their markets. Further, as shown by Table 5, its weighted average tariffs are amongst the group of countries which are considered to have the lowest tariffs in the world.
(g) The Spread of Basic Tariff Rates
In 2015–16, the range of maximum MFN tariffs for the different chapters covering agriculture33 is from 30 per cent to 150 per cent. Within this group, the most common maximum tariff is either 30 per cent or 100 per cent. For the non-agriculture products,34 Annex Table 1 shows that the highest maximum MFN tariffs apply to motor vehicles (125 per cent).
  For most tariff lines, a maximum or peak MFN applied tariff of 10 per cent is the most common rate. As shown by Table 6, about 78 per cent of tariff lines for non-agriculture products are between 5 to 10 per cent; 90 per cent of India’s tariff lines on non-agriculture products are in the range of 0 to 10 per cent.
  Annex Table 1 shows a large dispersion amongst the relatively higher tariffs for non-agricultural items, with ten different rates ranging from 12.5 to 125 per cent (without considering the rates for personal baggage). This indicates the possibility of rationalizing this tariff structure to both reduce the number of tariffs rates and to simplify the tariff regime. In this context, it is worth recalling the Chelliah Committee Report of 1993, which had recommended a smaller number of basic tariff rates even in the early phase of reform, in comparison to the present spread of tariffs.
  The Chelliah Committee Report stated:
A large number of rates not only create administrative problems, but leads to non-transparency in the degrees of effective protection given to different products as well as to distortions in the allocation of resources. By keeping only a limited number of rates, we shall render administration of the tariff a fairly easy task, and by limiting the spread, we shall minimize distortions . . . . We are recommending that by 1997 or 1998 March end, the structure of ad valorem rates of duties in place should be: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30. In addition, when non-essential consumer goods are allowed to be imported, there should be another ‘slot’ for them, namely, 50 per cent.35
The number of basic tariff rates have come down in a major way, from twenty-two different basic tariff rates in 1991–92, to only four by 2001–02.36 We can see from Annex Table 1 that the number of these different basic tariff rates have gone up since the early 2000s.
  This suggests that the current spread of tariff rates is an obvious area to focus for tariff reform.
(h) Auxiliary Duties, Additional Duties, Special Additional Duties, and Surcharges
  Before 1991, India imposed high auxiliary duties on imports. These were merged with basic tariffs and the overall combined tariff level (basic rate plus auxiliary, inclusive of specific duties) was capped at the rate specified in the Budget: 150 per cent in 1991, 110 per cent in 1992, and so on as discussed earlier. In the 1993 Budget, the government merged the auxiliary duty with the basic duty rate, thus doing away with the auxiliary duty.
  In addition to basic customs duty, all goods imported into India are subject to additional duty of customs, popularly known in India as ‘CVD’.37 This additional duty of customs is equivalent to excise duty,38 and is refundable through the credit provided under the CENVAT scheme.39 Further, imported goods are also subject to special additional duty of customs, popularly known in India as ‘SAD’. This SAD is levied in lieu of state taxes, local taxes or any other charges.40 The additional duty and special additional duty on imports have continued to be part of the import-duty regime in different years. This is supposed to be in lieu of internal tax, in order to provide a level playing field for domestic producers. The tax system allows crediting these taxes back if the product is used as a part of the value chain and subsequently enters domestic sales as an input.
  From time to time, the government has changed the additional and special additional duties, and imposed surcharges. For example, a special duty of 2 per cent was imposed in the 1996–97 Budget,41 which was raised to 5 per cent in September 1997. This was discontinued in the Budget of 1999–2000. Nonetheless, a uniform surcharge of 10 per cent of the basic duty was imposed on many products. The proportion of additional and special additional duties in total charges on imports at the border was small when tariffs were high. With a decrease in tariffs where bulk of them are not over 10 per cent, the significance of CVD and SAD has increased in the total charges at the border.
(i) Devaluation/Depreciation of the Rupee
An important point to note is that increased protection is provided to domestic production because of high tariffs as well as depreciation of the currency. The value of the Indian rupee fell in comparison to the US dollar, at the same time when India’s average tariffs declined (see Chart 1). In 1991, the reduction in tariffs announced through the Budget was cushioned due to a devaluation of the Indian rupee, with a two-step downward exchange-rate adjustment by 9 per cent and 11 per cent between 1–3 July 1991 in order to counter the massive draw down in the foreign-exchange reserves, and to instil confidence in the investors and to improve domestic competitiveness.42 In March 1992, India established the ‘Liberalized Exchange Rate Management System’ (LERMS) with a dual exchange-rate system for one year.
  Chart 1 shows that the period till 1992–93 saw a devaluation of the rupee, which more than compensated for the reduction in India’s trade-weighted average tariff reduction.
  A unified exchange-rate system was established in March 1993, with the exchange-rate system moving from an adjustable peg to a market-based exchange rate for trading. As stated in the Budget speech of 1993–94:
. . . last year . . . a dual exchange-rate regime was introduced, and import licensing was eliminated on most items of capital goods, raw materials, intermediates and components. These items became freely importable against foreign exchange purchased in the market. The system has worked fairly well and the market exchange rate has been remarkably stable. The existence of a dual rate, however, hurts exporters and other foreign exchange earners who have to surrender 40 per cent of their earnings at the official rate, getting the benefit of the higher market rate on only 60 per cent. Many exporters have said that this amounts to a tax on exporters of goods and services whose continuation cannot be justified at a time when exports must receive our fullest support. There is merit in this point of view, and the experience of the past year gives ground for confidence that we can unify the exchange rate and still manage the balance of payments with a reasonable degree of stability in the exchange rate. The government has therefore decided to eliminate the dual rate arrangement. All exporters, as well as other foreign exchange earners such as our workers abroad, will henceforth be allowed to convert 100 per cent of their earnings at the market rate. All imports will also henceforth have to be paid for at the market rate. (para 26)
The next five years from 1993–94 onwards saw a period of relative stability for both weighted average tariffs and Net Effective Exchange Rate (NEER), and then the decline in average tariffs outstripped the fall in the value of the rupee (see Chart 1).43
  Thus, it is clear that devaluation/depreciation provided a cushion to the domestic industry when tariffs were decreasing, especially in the initial years of reform. In certain years, the Budget speech has also noted the impact of depreciation and the breathing space it provided.

An important aspect of exchange rates and competitiveness is that we need to go beyond NEER and consider the movement of the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER), which adjusts for inflation rates. While the declining NEER denotes a weakening of the rupee, the competitive conditions faced by domestic producers also depend on the changes in price levels in different countries. India’s REER shows a different picture in comparison to its NEER (see Chart 2). The REER saw a decline in the value of the rupee in the two years after 1990–91 due to the devaluation, but has since then been largely stable or seen a small increase. The relative competitiveness of the rupee has thus not improved, even though a substantial fall in the value of the rupee has taken place in nominal terms.

(j) Simplification of Tariff Regime
The 2002–03 Budget expressed a vision that ‘by the year 2004–05, there would be only two basic rates of customs duties, namely, 10 per cent covering generally raw materials, intermediates and components and 20 per cent covering generally final products.’
  Over time, different finance ministers have reduced the number of tariff slabs, but India still has a large number of them. Nonetheless, two very important changes have taken place over time.
  One, there is a concentration of tariffs in a single, small range: about 72 per cent of tariffs are in the range of 5–10 per cent; for non-agriculture products, the share is about 78 per cent. In contrast, the largest concentration in 1993 was with tariff ranges of 30–40 per cent and 80–90 per cent, each with about a quarter of the total tariff lines. Second, most tariff lines are with tariffs at 10 per cent or below.44
  Thus, in effect, the Indian tariff structure has been considerably simplified compared to earlier. However, we are still far from the vision expressed in the 2002–03 Budget, and more needs to be done to further simplify the tariff structure.45
(k) Structure of Tariff Escalation
The Chelliah Committee Report had proposed its tariffs with a view to have tariff escalation or effective protection for domestic industry, with inputs or products at lower stages of processing having lower tariffs than the final products. For average tariffs, this was achieved by 1996–97 and 1997–98 (see Table 8). However, compared to the late 1990s, the tariffs on unprocessed products did not decrease much but those on semi-processed and processed manufactured products decreased significantly. This led to a reduction in effective protection; in fact, one of the concerns of some industries in India is that the tariffs on their inputs are higher than the tariffs on the finished products. This is one of the areas of tariff reform that remains incomplete.

(l) Tariff Concessions
Tariff concessions were quite pervasive when reform began in 1991. They made the tariff scheme complex and non-transparent, with tariffs for specific product categories often linked to end-use aimed at social, industrial, economic and industrial use for tariff classifications at six, eight or ten tariff lines. Over time, the scope of these was enhanced when free trade zones were established. In line with duty drawback or refund schemes across the world for imported and domestic inputs used in exports, India also provides other concessions when a product is exported.46 The proportion of this aspect of concessions has increased over time as the share of imports in India’s exports has increased. Analysis of Indian products as part of global value chains shows that: ‘The foreign content of India’s exports has increased significantly in the last two decades, more than doubling from under 10 per cent in 1995 to 24 per cent in 2011.’47
  Even today, India continues to have a number of concessions in its tariff regime. Though less than earlier, they are still a part of the system, introducing unpredictability and lack of transparency.
(m) Lower Tariffs Due to Free Trade Agreements (FTAs)
With the ongoing WTO negotiations facing a deadlock, the focus of trade negotiations has moved towards FTAs. For both strategic and economic reasons, therefore, India will have to focus on FTA while being active in improving the substantive content of the work in WTO.
  In the early 1990s, India had few Free Trade Agreements or the Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAs).48 Over time, these have increased and the proliferation of FTAs has been supplemented by larger agreements in the form of the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) or the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA), which cover many more areas than conventional market opening under FTAs. Most of the significant Indian FTAs/PTAs have been implemented in this century, in general from 2005 onwards. The agreements prior to 2005 were with relatively small coverage or less deep than the more comprehensive economic partnership agreements later; the first CECA was with Singapore, in 2005.49 In addition, India provides preferential schemes for least developed countries.
  The situation for India is summarized in a government note on FTAs as follows:
India has preferential access, economic cooperation and Free Trade Agreements (FTA) with about 54 individual countries. India has signed bilateral trade deals in the form of Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA)/Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA)/FTA/Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAs) with some 18 groups/countries. India is a late, and cautious, starter in concluding comprehensive preferential tariff agreements covering substantially all trade with some of its trading partners.50
The different agreements lead to diverse rules of origin criteria for imports from different sources. This causes additional costs of trading and confusion in carrying out international trade, particularly for small and medium enterprises.
  These preferential or free-trade initiatives have resulted in much lower tariffs faced by a number of India’s trading partners, a feature likely to increase further with new FTAs such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (RCEP).
  The combined effects on tariff decline due to MFN tariff reductions over time, exemptions on tariffs and to some extent the impact of FTAs/PTAs on tariffs can be seen in Table 5.
  Another way of considering the overall situation regarding the impact of concessions on tariffs is to consider the difference between the average MFN tariff and the average tariff reflected by basic customs revenue collected. Table 9 shows this difference between these two estimates. We can see that even though the average MFN tariff of India has decreased very significantly over time, the difference between India’s MFN tariffs and trade-weighted tariff average calculated from basic customs revenue is almost as much as the MFN simple tariff average itself.
  Table 9: India. MFN Tariff Simple Average, Trade-weighted Average Tariff Based on Basic Customs Revenue Collected, and Difference between MFN Average and Trade Weighted Average Tariff (Percentage)
 
Source: WTO and Table 5.
Though the estimates of simple average MFN tariff and weighted average tariff are not directly comparable, this difference does qualitatively indicate the large combined effect of tariff reduction resulting from concession schemes and the FTAs.51 Two insights seem relevant from this information.
  One, any judgement of the tariff regime of India based on the MFN tariffs would not be appropriate. Second, that there is a large potential for simplifying the existing tariff regime, and providing more transparent forms of lower tariffs.
5. Non-Tariff Measures
India’s non-tariff measures are mainly contingency trade protection measures (anti-dumping, countervailing measures and safeguards), Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) and Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) measures, quantity control or licensing and quantitative restrictions, and export-related measures (see Table 10).

Notes: (a) Contingent trade protection includes anti-dumping, countervailing measures (or anti-subsidy) and safeguard measures. (b) Other measures include: price-control measures (including additional taxes and charges), finance measures, measures affecting competition, trade-related investment measures, distribution restrictions, restrictions on post-sales services, subsidies (excluding export subsidies), government procurement restrictions, intellectual property, and rules of origin.
The largest number of contingency measures used by India are anti-dumping actions, as shown by Table 11 below.

In addition, UNCTAD reports contingency-protection measures affecting all members in terms of ongoing investigations (sixty-six for India), which, added to the figure in Table 11, makes it consistent with that in Table 10. For details on contingency-protection measures by UNCTAD, see
http://i-tip.unctad.org/Forms/TableView.aspx?mode=modify&action=search.
In this section, we will focus on three important non-tariff measures affecting imports: quantitative restrictions (including licensing), anti-dumping measures, and SPS/TBT measures.
(a) Quantitative Restrictions, Including Licensing
As in the case of every country, India has provisions for import restrictions, including import prohibition, quantitative restrictions or licensing. In many cases, these restrictions are for health and safety reasons, to meet environmental or moral objectives, or to implement obligations under international agreements.
  India’s import restriction regime today is much more liberal than the early 1990s, due to both the policy of easing trade restrictions over time and a consequence of India losing the WTO BOP-related dispute in 1999, which pertained to India’s quantitative import restrictions. Following the WTO dispute, India had to remove its quantitative restrictions that it had imposed for BOP reasons. It did so in two tranches, the first one by 1 April 2000 and the second by 1 April 2001: ‘At the DSB [Dispute Settlement Body of WTO] meeting of 5 April 2001, India announced that, with effect from 1 April 2001, it had removed the quantitative restrictions on imports in respect of the remaining 715 items and had thus implemented the DSB’s recommendations in this case.’52 (emphasis added)
  In the case of agriculture, the Uruguay Round Agreement required all quantitative restrictions to be replaced by ‘equivalent’ tariffs. Therefore, in one stroke, the quantitative import restrictions for agriculture were removed.
  In 1991, India’s import-licensing regime was considerably complex and highly restrictive. All imports unless specifically exempted were subject to licensing requirements, which operated under a system with twenty-six ‘positive’ commodity lists. Imports were classified under four broad categories: banned items, restricted items, limited permissible items, and open general licence (OGL) items. Different import-approval systems applied for different licence categories. While OGL was notionally unrestricted, several OGL items required government approval and were subject to ‘actual user’ conditions: the actual-user condition required the importer to also be a user of the imported product.
  This scheme was considerably simplified by the Export Import Policy of 1992, which replaced the previous lists by a consolidated ‘negative’ list that specified products subject to import licensing. Other products were freely importable. Nonetheless, almost all consumer goods were still under import licensing,53 and both consumer products and other products were part of the negative list.54
  Even today, India continues with import prohibitions and other restrictions on imports, mostly for health and safety reasons, technical compatibility of requisite standards, or moral or environmental reasons. In certain cases, the interests of domestic industries also form a basis of these policies. For these reasons, imports are prohibited for sixty eight-digit tariff lines (about 0.5 per cent of tariff lines). In addition, eight four-digit lines covering milk and milk products are at present temporarily prohibited for imports from China.55 Import licensing is required for 428 eight-digit tariff lines (about 3.6 per cent of the total lines) whose imports are restricted.56 In addition, toxic and other chemicals, psychotropic drugs and narcotic substances require import licensing; eight narcotic drugs are banned for imports, and three can be imported only by the Government Opium and Alkaloid Factory.57
  These types of various import prohibitions or restrictions are used by other nations as well, for reasons similar to those cited by India. These restrictions are normally not focused on import substitution, but on other public-policy reasons linked to, for instance, health, safety, moral reasons, and meeting international obligations (chemical weapons, endangered species, Montreal Protocol and other international agreements).
  Though India still has import restrictions in place, their number is much less than in 1991. The regime is more simple and transparent.
(b) Anti-dumping
India imposed its first-ever provisional anti-dumping duty in January 1993.58 Over the years, it has become among the largest users of anti-dumping measures in the world. On 30 June 2016, it had the second largest number of anti-dumping measures in force (twenty-one less than the topmost user, United States). See Table 12.
It is interesting that as India’s tariffs decreased, its number of anti-dumping actions increased over the next ten years, and continue to be at a significantly higher level compared to the initial years after the commencement of tariff reform (see Chart 3).59 This is consistent with the conventional understanding of the political economy of trade liberalization where the general opening up of the economy is accompanied by alternative trade restrictions like anti-dumping or other non-tariff measures to provide targeted protection to sensitive sectors whenever there is a felt need for doing so.

Source: WTO and Government of India.
Though India is amongst the largest users of anti-dumping in the world, till now only four of its anti-dumping actions have been brought to the dispute-settlement panel since the WTO was established in 1995. In contrast, forty-nine disputes have been brought against the United States, out of a total of 114 anti-dumping cases under the WTO dispute-settlement system. The third highest user in Table 10 (Brazil) has only two cases brought against its anti-dumping actions. Therefore, it is not just the number of actions but also the size of the economy or share in global trade that determines the total number of WTO disputes brought against the anti-dumping action of a country. For instance, China’s anti-dumping actions have faced eight disputes within the WTO, though its number of definitive anti-dumping measures in force on 30 June 2016 were about one-third the number of such actions taken by India. Therefore, as India’s market share increases together with the number of its anti-dumping measures, other nations subject to those actions will give greater importance to questioning the basis for those actions. In this background, it would be useful for Indian authorities to examine the procedures in place so that they follow both the WTO legal requirements in an obvious way as well as meet the criteria of good governance in general.60
  A significant feature in the context of contingent protection is that, until recently, India had not established regulations or amended its law to impose contingency protection measures under FTAs, a gap that needs to be addressed.
(c) SPS/TBT
Large international markets today are far more impacted by standards than tariffs or other non-tariff measures; even anti-dumping measures, which are far more numerous but limited in scope, do not affect trade at as wide-scale a level as standards. Furthermore, while anti-dumping measures are used only by the government, standards are imposed by both the government and the private sector, with most value chains subject to specified standards overseen by lead firms in that chain. Therefore, the standards are amongst the most significant trade measures in present-day markets. Further, their scope is increasing from only quality or health and safety concerns to include social and sustainability concerns that are now prominent in most large markets. Interestingly, these concerns are also increasingly emphasized in FDI.
  It is important to bear in mind the fact that standards are not always trade barriers or trade restrictions: They are required to achieve legitimate policy goals. They become barriers when their operational conditions or levels exceed what may be required to meet the desired objective. That is when trade concerns arise with respect to standards. Therefore, standards-related policies (SPS/TBT) address five aspects of policy: addressing trade-related concerns; transparency and provision of relevant information to stakeholders; opportunity to provide comments on standards when they are being formulated; bringing trade-related concerns to the attention of the implementing party and seeking solutions; and developing domestic capacity in the context of standards.
  Building domestic capacity to meet standards is an essential part of creating trade opportunities. However, in the context of international trade, meeting standards is not sufficient for exports to be accepted in other markets. Accepted conformity assessment procedures are very important to get agreement in other markets that standards have been met by the product exported to that market.
  The story of standards trade policy in India has been an increasing realization regarding the importance of all these factors: shifting from a focus on developing domestic standards towards aligning policies and capabilities towards international standards; recognition of the importance of private standards, conformity assessment, and expanding the capabilities of small and medium enterprise through focused training; and including social and sustainability standards in the scope of both training and conformity assessment.
  Recognizing the importance of standards for international trade, the Government of India established an annual meeting in 2014 under a Standards Conclave, which brings all standards-related stakeholders on a single platform and develops road maps for standards-related policies. The government has designated Quality Council of India (QCI) as India’s focal point agency for private standards. It has changed two laws to facilitate the policy framework for conformity assessment, has enabled training programmes that use step-wise upgrading of small and medium enterprises to reach regional or global standards, and has streamlined and increased scope of linking up with international standards. The government encourages or supports initiatives for MOUs between Indian agencies and international agencies that work on standards (i.e., agencies that develop or validate standards/conformity assessment). Such MOUs have been signed with the African nodal standards agency as well as those in many developed economies.
  Regarding India’s use of standards for trade restrictive purposes, it is useful to consider the specific trade concerns (STCs) raised in WTO about India’s SPS and TBT policies. These data show that India has been amongst the top ten economies whose standards were raised as a concern in the WTO, though far less than the top countries in terms of new STCs.61 Thus, for TBT, during 1995 to 2015, new concerns raised for Indian measures were twenty-four, in comparison to 102 for the EU, fifty-six for China and forty-seven for the US. For SPS, during 1995 to 2015, India’s policies were raised as STC in thirteen instances in the WTO’s committee on SPS, in comparison to seventy-seven for the EU, forty-five for the US and twenty-seven for China. It is worth bearing in mind that China became a member of WTO in November 2001, and its STCs were therefore mentioned in this process from only 2002 onwards.
  In terms of standards-related disputes in WTO, India has not faced many complaints. Only three WTO disputes have been raised with respect to Indian SPS policies and one for TBT.
  This could be both because India’s policies are a matter of lower concern and the fact that the Indian market is not large enough for more concerns to be expressed at the relevant SPS/TBT fora in the WTO. Nonetheless, there is a prevailing view amongst many stakeholders that India’s quality of domestic products and process standards need to improve, particularly for products of the large informal sector in India. This issue would need to be addressed through training and better implementation of existing systems, to encouraging and pacing the way for sequentially moving towards international standards. Some schemes that build capacities in a progressive and step-wise manner are now part of the Indian standards training methods.62
6. Export-related Policies
Similar to imports, India’s exports too are subject to controls and monitoring for several products, but with a much smaller coverage. In 1991, a limited number of exports were prohibited (mainly for moral or environmental reasons) or were subject to export quotas. A relatively larger number of products were subject to export licensing. While exports taxes were used, they were applied to selected specified products.63
  Exports policies have been reformed significantly since the early 1990s. Now, exporters have a self-assessment system to facilitate trade. Currently, about 80 per cent transactions are cleared without intervention by customs and 98 per cent of documents are processed electronically.64 Exporters are required to register and get a code for record and facilitating any processes. Several products are subject to quality inspections and certification. This is required both to reduce risks of exports being rejected and to meet various conditions relating to internationally agreed practices. Export taxes and cess do apply to a few items. In some cases, minimum export prices are imposed for some sensitive products. Likewise, exports of some products are prohibited or subject to export licensing: about 190 tariff-line items are subject to export licensing.
  Thus, over time, export-policy reform has facilitated and provided greater freedom to exporters to conduct their business. However, though major facilitating steps have been implemented, some aspects of the broad nature of policies remain similar to those used in the 1990s; although the restrictive coverage of such policies is much less today and their focus is on a limited number of products for various reasons of public policy.65
  We have earlier mentioned the schemes that provide concessions and support to exports. The Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) 2015–2020 aims to raise India’s share of global exports from 2 per cent to 3.5 per cent by 2020.66 Exports have conventionally been encouraged through various types of support schemes, e.g. duty exemption of remission schemes, export subsidies, export credit schemes, export promotion agencies established for specific products, twenty-nine separate export promotion councils provide advice and other support, and easier procedures for exports from Special Economic Zones.67
7. Services and Regulation as Integral Part of Trade-policy Reform
India is amongst a small number of countries whose experience has changed the conventional understanding that the pattern of growth follows a transition from agriculture to manufactures, and then to services. India is widely seen as more prominent in services exports than manufacturing and has served as a model for several other developing nations to seek opportunities from international trade in services.
  Many services, particularly in developing countries, were earlier provided by public-sector enterprises, as they require large, fixed investment. Many major services sectors were earlier considered as not being amenable to international trade. This situation changed with the advent of new technology (particularly, communications), increasing sophistication of financial markets, growth in FDI, international supply chains, and a breakup of existing large service providers in certain service sectors, which showed that the smaller size of service suppliers could also be efficient. These changes led inter alia to seeking trade-policy regulatory disciplines within trade agreements, most importantly at the WTO.
  An interesting feature of the progress of trade negotiations in WTO was a recognition that trade in services could occur in four different ways, including movement of labour, capital and consumers, in addition to the conventional cross-border trade which is the way goods trade is conceptualized.
  Thus, trade-policy reform in services requires different combination of policy steps in comparison to goods, including market access and regulatory reform to create conditions for introducing competition in the sector and to ensure good quality of services. The possibility of new entrants in services markets with dominant suppliers meant that regulatory conditions had to be created to enable efficient entry and maintenance of a ‘level playing field’, in order to address the possibility of anti-competitive behaviour in the market. This implies the provision of both B2B and B2C services in a timely manner at the requisite quality and reasonable prices.
  Consequently, an essential part of services trade reform is establishment of a regulatory body and a regulatory framework to give predictability and facilitate entry of competitors in the market. In addition, the large network or fixed capital required for expanding the reach and scope of services may need both supportive policies and a reorientation of public policy.
  The Indian government has established regulatory bodies in several services-related areas such as telecom, ports, insurance, pensions, food safety, petroleum and natural gas, electricity, and inland waterways. In certain cases, such as power, separate regulatory authorities have been established at the Centre and the individual states because of the nature of distinct responsibilities in that service area for the Centre and the states. In addition to sector-specific regulatory bodies, India has also established those with a more wide-ranging reach, such as the Competition Commission of India. The government has also helped with the development of infrastructure in several of these areas (in railways, it is effectively a monopoly), and some of its flagship projects focusing on the digital, ease of doing business, skill building, and improving cost effectiveness, contribute to reform and efficiency in the services sector. Thus, services trade-policy reform, which became a focus of reform much later than goods trade policy, has progressed tremendously. Nonetheless, as shown in Table 13, there is considerable scope for improvement in a number of these areas.68

Notes: (1) Range for logistics covers logistics cargo-handling, logistics storage and warehouse, logistics freight-forwarding, and logistics customs brokerage.
(2) Higher the value of the index, the greater the restriction.
Improving the efficiency in services sector is of major importance because services are products that potentially have extensive upstream and downstream impact in the production chain. They affect the operations of a country’s economic system relating to trade and investment, value chains and ability to compete with others to be an effective part of international value chains. An important part of services reform is to introduce timeliness and quick response, efficient and effective infrastructure, and procedures that seamlessly link up the different part of the supply chain.
8. Trade Facilitation
The combination of FDI, international value chains and services reform has led to a shift in the focus of trade policy from restrictions towards trade facilitation. Trade facilitation policies include a focus on timeliness, transparency, paperless procedures (domestic and cross-border), simplifying procedural formalities, and institutional arrangement as well as domestic and international cooperation.69 The OECD includes a more specific list of components in its consideration of trade facilitation: advance rulings, appeal procedures, fees and charges, formalities (documents), formalities (automation), formalities (procedures), internal border agency cooperation. governance and impartiality, information availability, and the involvement of the trade community.70
  These aspects have been a part of reform in India for about two decades, with the momentum picking up in recent years. Significant importance to trade facilitation was given by the Task Force on Indirect Taxes, set up under the chairmanship of Vijay Kelkar.71 More recently, India has signed on to the Trade Facilitation Agreement of the WTO. Thus, while the importance of trade facilitation was recognized in the early 2000s, a stronger focus on it has emerged in this decade after a substantive and practical recognition of its significance for improving competitiveness, ability to connect with international value chains and attracting FDI based on ease of doing business within the country.72 Even in the Budget of 2016, specific focus was given to some trade-facilitation measures.73
  Thus, considerable movement has taken place towards trade facilitation in India, but as in the case of other trade-policy areas, much more needs to be done.74
9. Other Emerging Trade-policy-related Issues
The discussion above shows that the scope of trade policy has expanded with larger coverage of existing topics and addition of new topics under the framework of trade-related policies. Examples of both these can be found most clearly in TPP, in the chapters relating to market access in goods and services, competition policy, investment, e-commerce, IPR, TBT and SPS, regulatory coherence, trade facilitation, supply chains, cooperation and capacity building.
  Recent trade agreements or negotiations indicate that trade policy is also seen as an integral part of strategic policy. Furthermore, with an increase in economic importance of countries such as China in global trade, producers in developed economies who are losing market share, have started taking a closer look at the conditions of production in the emerging economies. The objective is to have a ‘level playing field’ and one of the areas of emphasis is on the social and sustainability standards regime in different economies. Both formal and informal efforts are being made to extend the standards prevalent in the supply chains of developed markets to other parts of the global markets as well.
  Another development regarding trade policy is the growing importance of informal methods in comparison to formal ones. The formal efforts are through trade agreements. Informal efforts are through decisions of groups such as G7, or the OECD guidelines, and most importantly through private standards that are a major part of trade transactions in large markets.
  Yet another area with significant private presence is the digital platform, where technology is progressing rapidly and the public policymaker does not have the capacity to keep abreast with new developments and policy implications without support from the private stakeholders who are more closely associated with these technologies. Further, a digital platform combined with mobility and new technologies such as 3-D printing or M2M communications, makes it very difficult to determine location or to ascertain ex ante either the package of services that could be bundled together or the pricing strategy which could be used when diverse products are bundled as a package. This, in turn, has implications for the relevant regulatory regime which would be effective or relevant in the new situation. The limited extent of national jurisdiction in a world where location is indeterminate also points towards an increasing need for collaboration amongst the relevant regulatory agencies in different nations.
  In this context, a policy emphasized frequently by producers in developed economies is the IPR regime, particularly for new technologies, including digital or e-commerce. Many ‘sunrise industries’ embody new technology and knowledge, and IPR becomes an important mechanism to sustain market leadership in those areas.
  Yet another area that is acquiring prominence in trade-policy discussions and negotiations is the issue of exchange rate used as a trade-policy tool. This issue is emphasized both by developing economies (e.g. Brazil) and developed economies (e.g. the US in its TPP negotiations and thereafter). The objective is to develop disciplines against the use of exchange rate as a mechanism for tilting the competitive position in favour of domestic producers.
  These developments have several implications. One, the composition of trade policy becomes more open-ended with an evolving set of new issues becoming part of consideration, including those mentioned above and others such as corporate social responsibility,75 corruption,76 and remuneration systems.77 Two, the increasing scope of trade policy means that no single international institution deals with all relevant issues. Therefore, policymakers would need a comprehensive perspective and knowledge of both the relevant topics and initiatives at the diverse institutions that deal with them. Three, without a common understanding, different regulatory and standards schemes are likely to come up in different economies, showing a need for regulatory coherence at the bilateral, regional or multilateral level. Four, there are considerable tensions in world markets following the adverse economic conditions since the major economic decline in 2008–09, and the pressure on jobs as new labour-saving technologies emerge, creating significant difficulties particularly for the small and medium enterprises. This implies a need to augment the framework of trade policy from one with a major focus on market opening or higher levels of trade-policy disciplines, to one which includes mechanisms (or safeguards) to address trade-related concerns in domestic markets, collaborate and assist each other in building capacity for SMEs and develop closer regulatory cooperation and coherence.
  All these areas require coordinated efforts amongst domestic policymakers and industry in any nation, to better address the large and increasing agenda of today’s trade-policy issues.
10. Conclusion
Trade-policy reform in India has come a long way on the road, which was paved since 1991, with a large reduction in tariffs (including peak tariffs), simplification of tariffs, improved regime for non-tariff measures, services regulation and opening up internal markets for services, greater opportunities for investment, better trade-facilitation institutions and policies, and improving domestic capacities to meet the relevant standards required to link up with domestic and international value chains.
  Since 1991, trade-policy reform has opened up India’s trade. It has increasingly provided Indian consumers and producers access respectively to world-class consumer goods and the relevant capital and intermediate goods. The situation today is extremely different compared to the period when trade policy encompassed high border restrictions. The major trade-policy reform, together with other policy changes, have led to a greater integration of India with the world economy, and improved capacities as well as potential for growth.
  It is worth recalling that India’s trade reforms were accomplished with a high degree of success in the sense that domestic disruption was manageable. High trade growth was achieved until the recent past, with ratio of exports and imports to GDP reaching about 49 per cent in 2014 from about 24 per cent in 2000. The current-account deficit has also been contained at sustainable levels except for a brief period between 2011 and 2013.
  The trade deficit, however, has been significantly high. With the recent experience of exports and imports declining for one and a half years and subdued global markets, policymakers would be particularly hesitant in their approach towards further trade-policy reform in terms of border measures.
  However, the content and substance of trade policy has expanded compared to the 1990s. We must again examine whether there is a need to consider further trade-policy reform with significant impact on consumers, producers and economic efficiency.
  Further, in addition to various trade-policy changes, it is worth recalling that in the initial years, trade-policy reform was accompanied by exchange-rate changes as an important complementary tool to soften the impact of tariff reductions. Bearing in mind the complementarity of changes in tariffs and exchange rates, and the increasing reliance and significance of exchange-rate issues in the context of trade policy, a pertinent question would be whether attention is needed to address this situation through the exchange rate. This is especially so since the REER now is higher than in 2008–09, the years since global trade has suffered due to the massive economic and financial crisis. Of course, ultimately, India would need to improve its overall productivity through technological and skill enhancement, in order to progress beyond the middle-income category to become a high-income economy. Several trade-policy reforms have contributed to paving the way towards greater competitiveness of Indian enterprises.
  In the area of tariffs, we saw in this paper that the prevailing view of India being a high-tariff economy is not correct. India’s average applied MFN tariffs are close to those of some APEC economies. Importantly, India’s weighted average tariffs calculated based on customs tariffs are very low by global standards, close to those for economies considered to have amongst the lowest average tariffs in the world. This suggests that India’s further tariff reform may need to mainly consider lowering the tariff peaks applicable to certain product categories, reducing the number of rates applied, and simplifying the tariff regime to make it more transparent and predictable.
  On non-tariff measures (including for services), this paper has shown a number of areas where more needs to be done to consolidate the reform that is already under way. India is emphasizing on a number of facilitating policies through its flagship programmes such as Make in India. The different initiatives would need to be advanced in a coordinated manner, with further simplification and reducing arbitrariness. These steps must be supplemented by capacity augmentation and regulatory coherence, two very significant reform-oriented initiatives that will need to be combined with other efforts, to implement trade-policy reform through an integrated and coordinated approach.
  We see from the discussion in this paper that while significant trade-policy reform has been achieved, India still has a number of remaining areas to address even in the conventional trade-policy areas, e.g. simplification and completing some features of trade-policy reform that were identified in the first few years since 1991. The steps required include these as well as more recent areas covered in trade-policy discussions. Moreover, we need to consider trade policy and domestic policy in an integrated manner, keeping in mind the evolution of trade policy, emergence of new market conditions, and the growth of both formal and informal mechanisms that determine the opportunities provided by global markets.
  This implies that the trade policy and trade negotiations governance mechanisms would need to have an overarching reach with timely, informed and interactive consideration of issues. A new approach, using the tools of new technology and an overall large database shared commonly amongst the governance agencies, would need to be developed.
  Important aspects of future trade-policy reform include establishing systems to enable such quick information coming to the policymakers about the diverse areas, which are emerging as part of the extended framework of trade policy, both formal and informal. In this context, policymakers need to participate to the extent possible, in both formal and informal initiatives, dealing with the expanded trade-policy agenda. Furthermore, the new emerging developments due to the evolving or disruptive technologies, growth of social and sustainability considerations, and the tendency of policy issues to spill over into the practices of private-sector lead firms in global value chains imply that the policymaker has to not only work with a much wider agenda than before, but also interact much more closely with the private sector than is the conventional practice.

Annex I
Parts of the Indian Budget Speech in 1993 that Relate to Customs Duties and explain the Various Considerations Underlying the Customs Duty Reform:
(Paragraphs 82–99. See http://indiabudget.nic.in/bspeech/bs199394.pdf)
82. Since 1973, we have been levying a separate auxiliary duty in addition to the basic customs duty. In order to simplify the tariff structure and the assessment process, I propose to do away with the separate auxiliary duty and merge it with the basic duty.
83. Our first priority in restructuring customs duty should be in the area of capital goods and project imports since these duties affect the incentives for new investment. Last year, the duty on projects and general machinery was brought down from 80 per cent to 55 per cent. This is still too high compared with rates in competitor countries and a further reduction is necessary. I, therefore, propose to lower the import duty on projects and general machinery to 35 per cent. Projects in certain priority sectors such as power, coal mining and petroleum refining currently attract a duty rate of 30 per cent. I propose to reduce the rate to 25 per cent in the case of coal mining and petroleum refining. In view of the special importance of the power sector, the duty on power projects is being reduced to 20 per cent and this rate is also being extended to machinery required for modernization and renovation of power plants.
84. The House can rest assured that in restructuring duties on capital goods, I have made every effort to protect the legitimate interests of domestic capital goods industry. We have had extensive discussions with various ministries as well as representatives of concerned (sic) industries. In order to ensure that lower duties on sixteen imported machinery do not hurt the domestic capital goods industry, it is necessary to lower the import duty on components, to enable our manufacturers to compete effectively. I, therefore, propose to reduce to 25 per cent the duty on components of general machinery, which presently is either 40 per cent or 35 per cent. In order, however, to ensure that domestic industries producing such components are not adversely affected, I propose to impose countervailing duty on such components at 10 per cent with full facility of setoff under MODVAT.
85. At present, there are a number of other capital goods, including various types of machine tools, which attract different rates of duty in the range of 60 per cent to 110 per cent. There are also instruments, which attract duties varying from 40 per cent to 110 per cent. I propose to rationalize this structure into three duty rate slots, viz. 40 per cent, 60 per cent and 80 per cent. The rationalization involves generally a duty reduction between 20 to 30 percentage points. Consequential reduction is being made in the rates of duty on specified parts and components.
86. Hand-operated tools are capital goods for artisans and skilled workers and currently attract duties varying from 40 per cent to 110 per cent. I propose to prescribe a uniform rate of 40 per cent for all these tools.
87. The logic of reducing duties on capital goods requires lowering of duties on metals and metal goods as well, as these are the basic raw materials of the domestic capital goods industry. Accordingly, to help domestic producers, I propose to lower the customs-duty rates on ferrous metals by 10 to 20 percentage points in most cases. In line with these changes, the import duty on steel scrap is being refixed at 15 per cent. The import duty on specified refractory raw materials is being reduced to 30 per cent. Turning to non-ferrous metals, I propose to reduce the duty rates by 10 to 55 percentage points in most cases. The resulting rates on unwrought and unalloyed forms will vary from 25 per cent to 50 per cent and on wrought forms from 70 per cent to 80 per cent.
88. The duty structure for chemicals is characterized by a multiplicity of rates and many irrationalities. Input duties are often out of line with duties on finished products. I, therefore, propose to restructure the duty rates on chemicals with a view to significantly lowering duty rates at the upper end and also ensuring that the duty rates on inputs are not generally higher than the duty on end products. The present duty rates on basic feed stocks such as ethylene, propylene, butadiene, benzene, styrene and ethylene dichloride vary between 25 per cent and 80 per cent. These rates are being replaced by a uniform low duty rate of 15 per cent. The duties on xylenes, paraxylene, toluene, acrylonitrile and cumene are being reduced to 40 per cent. The duties on DMT, PTA and MEG, which represent a higher stage of production, are being reduced and unified at 70 per cent. In the case of caprolactam, however, the duty is being increased from 50 per cent to 60 per cent, in order to adequately protect the interests of the domestic units.
89. The electronics industry has the potential of becoming a world-class industry contributing to our export effort and to employment generation. I propose to take up this challenge. The rates of duty on project imports and on specified capital goods for electronics attract duty at either 30 per cent or 50 per cent at present. I propose to reduce these rates to a uniform rate of 25 per cent. The import duties on raw materials, piece-parts and components at present are levied at 40 per cent, 60 per cent and 80 per cent. These rates are being reduced to 20 per cent, 35 per cent and 50 per cent respectively. The import duty on specified raw materials for the manufacture of optical fibre cables is being drastically reduced from 90 per cent to 20 per cent in recognition of the urgency of extending and modernizing the telecom sector.
90. In order to strengthen our export capability in existing export-thrust areas such as textiles, leather, marine products, gems and jewellery, where we have a comparative advantage, I propose to reduce the import duty on specified capital goods for these sectors from 40 per cent to 25 per cent. In addition, certain recommendations have been made by the Groups on Extreme Focus items for export for augmenting the export potential of certain sectors such as food processing, horticulture and floricultural industries. Accordingly, the import duty on specified items for these sectors is being reduced to 25 per cent.
91. The ship-breaking industry is employment intensive and an important source of raw materials for the secondary sector of our steel industry. In order to encourage the growth of this industry, I propose to prescribe a lower merged duty of customs at 5 per cent ad valorem. The ferrous materials obtained from breaking up of such ships etc., which are presently subject to excise duty are being fully exempted.
92. Our film industry is one of the largest in the world in terms of the footage of films produced. Although it has achieved this status without much need for incentives, it is now facing greater competition from the electronic media, and deserves some special encouragement. I, therefore, propose to reduce the duties on jumbo rolls of cine positive films from 55 per cent to 25 per cent and on finished cine film rolls from about 65 per cent to 40 per cent. I also propose to reduce the duty on negative cine films from about 35 per cent to 25 per cent.
93. In order to encourage the development of non-conventional energy sources, especially solar energy, the import duty on specified raw materials and items of this industry is being reduced by 15 to 20 percentage points. In respect of wind-operated electricity generators, I propose to reduce the import duty from 40 per cent to 25 per cent.
94. As a gesture of goodwill towards Bangladesh, I propose to fully exempt the famous Jamdanee saris from payment of import duties. Small-scale units, eligible for excise duty exemption for clearances to domestic area are at present required to pay excise duty on goods exported by them to Nepal and Bhutan. I propose to exempt these from this levy. I hope these steps will make a contribution towards improving trade with SAARC countries.
95. At present, accredited press cameramen have the facility of importing photographic equipment free of duty up to a limit of Rs 60,000 but no such facility is available to other journalists to import specialized equipment such as laptop computers, personal computers, fax machines and typewriters. I have often wondered whether this explains why my photographs in the press are better than the editorial comments! As a measure of my commitment to encourage modern technology in Indian journalism, and in recognition of the sterling role played by our pressmen in creating a wider appreciation of issues of economic reform in the country, I propose to allow accredited journalists a one-time facility to import such equipment duty free up to a value of Rs 60,000.
96. The duty rate on certain specified items of baggage was recently reduced from 255 per cent to 150 per cent. As a measure of simplification, I propose to reduce the general baggage rate itself from 255 per cent to 150 per cent.
97. In line with these reductions in import duties for individual sectors, and keeping in mind the present exchange rate, there is scope for reduction in the maximum rate of duty on all goods. Accordingly, I propose to reduce the maximum rate from 110 per cent to 85 per cent except for a few items, including passenger baggage and alcoholic beverages.
98. I am aware that Honourable Members will be concerned that lowering of import duties and import liberalization may put too much pressure on our industry and make it vulnerable to unfair competition and dumping. I would like to assure Honourable Members that these issues have been carefully considered and the proposed changes will not put undue pressure on industry. The change in the exchange rate over the past two years has created considerable room for duty reduction without hurting domestic industry. Besides, I am also reducing duties on raw materials and inputs, which will help to reduce cost for our producers, enabling them to compete more effectively. Even with these changes, duties on finished products will be well above the long-term structure recommended by the Chelliah Committee. We can move to that goal in phases over the next few years. As for unfair competition through dumping, our anti-dumping laws are already operational and action under these laws will be taken expeditiously whenever it is needed. I may mention that provisional action has recently been taken in one case.
99. In last year’s Budget, export duties had been imposed on iron ore and unpolished granite. Certain difficulties faced by these sectors have since been brought to my notice. I, therefore, propose to withdraw the export duty on iron ore and unpolished granite.
Annex II: Excerpts from Budget Speeches in Various Years
1992
77. Last year, I had begun the process of reducing import duties by lowering the ad valorem rates of basic plus auxiliary duties of customs to a maximum of 150 per cent. I now propose to lower the peak tariff level further by reducing the basic plus auxiliary rates of import duties (inclusive of specific duties) to a maximum of 110 per cent, with the exception of passenger baggage and alcoholic beverages.
1993
See Annex I, paragraphs 82, 97 and 98.
1994
56. . . . key features of my customs tariff reform proposals are:
1. Further reduction in the peak rate of customs duty;
2. Substantial reduction in duties on key raw materials, such as steel and chemicals;
3. Reduction in customs duties on capital goods to boost investment combined with other incentives, which will help the domestic capital goods industry;
4. Reduction or removal of anomalies caused by import duties on raw materials and components being higher than on finished products;
5. A systematic effort to unify rates on similar products to serve both economic rationality and to reduce the scope for classification disputes;
6. A major pruning of notifications, including end-use exemptions to about half their present number, thus reducing discretionary power and possibilities for disputes;
57. I propose to reduce the peak rate of customs duty from 85 per cent to 65 per cent. Items like baggage and liquor will however continue to attract higher duty as at present.
1995
77. I shall deal first with import duties. The present peak rate of import duty of 65 per cent is still very high compared to other developing countries, let alone industrialized nations. I propose to continue the process of phased reduction in the peak rate by lowering it to 50 per cent.
1997
110. On more than one occasion, I have stated that we would achieve the average levels of tariffs prevalent in ASEAN countries by the turn of the century. This will give time to Indian industry to adjust to these changes. This year’s proposals should be seen in this background.
111. I propose to reduce the peak rate of customs duty from 50 per cent to 40 per cent.
112. High levels of customs duties on capital goods are inconsistent with our policy of attracting the best technology. Greenfield investments in large projects should be globally competitive. I have tried to harmonize the needs of the Indian industry with the requirements of the capital goods sector. I, therefore, propose a modest reduction in duty on capital goods from 25 per cent to 20 per cent. This reduced rate of 20 per cent will also apply to project imports. Over the next two to three years, these rates would need to be further adjusted to conform to levels prevalent in other developing Asian countries.
1999
71. Mr Speaker, Sir, I now turn to my proposals relating to customs duties. My proposals here reflect a balance of differing considerations. On the one hand, we are committed to a calibrated integration of our economy with the world economy. This would entail further phasing down of our customs duties to Asian levels. On the other hand, is the need to raise revenue and the fact that in a year of exceptional turbulence and uncertainty in the world economy, our industry should be cushioned against unusual surges of competitive pressure from imports.
72. Sir, a special customs duty of 2 per cent was imposed in the Budget of 1996–97, and a further special customs duty of 3 per cent was imposed on certain items in 1997–98. The special customs duty of 5 per cent is in force till 31.3.1999. I have in the course of another discussion assured this House that the period of validity of this special customs duty will not be extended. I announce the discontinuance of the 5 per cent special customs duty with effect from 28.2.1999.
73. After careful examination of various possibilities, and close interaction with the apex organizations of Commerce and Industry, I propose to reduce the existing seven major ad valorem rates of customs duty to five basic rates. The new rates will be:
1. 5 per cent, which will remain unchanged;
2. 15 per cent by substituting the existing 10 per cent rate;
3. 25 per cent by merging the 20 per cent and 25 per cent rates;
4. 35 per cent by merging the 30 per cent and 35 per cent rates;
5. 40 per cent, which will remain unchanged.
75. To garner revenue to meet the country’s irreducible needs, I propose a uniform surcharge of 10 per cent on all commodities, excluding the following categories:
1. Crude Oil and Petroleum Products;
2. Items attracting 40 per cent rate of basic duty;
3. Certain GATT-bound items;
4. Gold and Silver
76. Taking into account that special customs duty is being discontinued, and that crude oil and petroleum products are exempt from surcharge, the effective import duty rates on these products will stand reduced. This is consistent with the government’s established policy of rationalizing indirect taxes on these products in an agreed time frame.
77. By exempting items attracting 40 per cent rate of basic duty from the surcharge, there is a modest but clear reduction in the peak rate of protective customs duty from 45 per cent to 40 per cent.
2000
108. I am conscious that in this area, I face serious constraints. We have to maintain a judicious balance between the need for providing adequate protection and growth impulses to the domestic industry and calibrating tariffs to international levels. We also need to carry the reform and rationalization process further.
109. Taking all factors into consideration, I propose to reduce the peak rate of basic customs duty from 40 per cent to 35 per cent, thereby reducing the total number of customs-duty rates from five to four, i.e., 35 per cent, 25 per cent, 15 per cent and 5 per cent.
110. The surcharge of 10 per cent, which I am constrained to continue on revenue considerations, will also apply to the new peak rate of 35 per cent. Crude oil and petroleum products, certain WTO bound items and gold and silver would continue to be exempt.
114. Customs is not all about raising revenues. It is also a powerful tool for building our industrial capabilities and improving our international competitiveness. I propose to take several measures in this regard, picking up three sectors for special attention. These are integral parts of the ‘convergence revolution’, which is fast becoming a reality.
115. First, and foremost, the Information Technology (IT) sector, which leads the current excitement. I propose to reduce the customs duty on several items for the IT sector.
2001
102. In my earlier budgets, I have endeavoured to ensure a continuity of approach in framing my revenue proposals. The principles that have guided me have been the need for growth in revenues, simplification and rationalization of the tax regime, and effective tax compliance through measures, which are friendly for the honest taxpayer, and a deterrent to the evader. I have reduced the number of rates in both customs and excise duties, simplified procedures and introduced measures to improve tax compliance. I have given up my discretionary power to grant excise and customs duty exemptions in individual cases thus saving hundreds of crores of revenue for Government. The policy of penalties against tax evaders has also been made non-discretionary. With all these steps, I have sought to put an end to a system that pressure groups or lobbies could influence. My attempt this year is to take this process to its logical conclusion.
122. In my previous budgets, I have reduced the total number of major customs-duty rates to four, that is, 35 per cent, 25 per cent, 15 per cent and 5 per cent. I do not wish to propose any further reduction in the number of customs-duty rates this year. However, I propose to discontinue the surcharge of 10 per cent. With this, peak level of customs duty will decline marginally from 38.5 per cent to 35 per cent.
123. All agricultural produce already attract the peak rate of duty of 35 per cent or more. Current tariffs on major cereals are: Wheat (50 per cent), Rice (70 per cent/80 per cent) and Maize (50 per cent). I now propose to increase the customs duty on tea, coffee, copra, and coconut and desiccated coconut from the present 35 per cent to 70 per cent.
126. Mr Speaker, Sir, with the abolition of the remaining Quantitative Restrictions in April this year, second-hand cars will also become freely importable. To allay the fears of surge in import of second-hand cars, the rate of basic customs duty on their import will be raised to 105 per cent, which is three times the peak rate. The total duty now applicable to second-hand cars will be more than 180 per cent. I propose a similar structure of duty for the import of old multi-utility vehicles, scooters and motor cycles.
2002
132. The House may recall that, in my last Budget, I had announced that I would move progressively to reduce the peak rate of customs duty to 20 per cent within three years. I had also said that the modalities for this would be worked out in time for the next Budget. I had accordingly set up an Inter-Ministerial Working Group to recommend the modalities. The group has suggested a road map for this starting with this year’s Budget. After careful consideration of the group’s report, I have decided that, by the year 2004–05, there would be only two basic rates of customs duties, namely, 10 per cent covering generally raw materials, intermediates and components and 20 per cent covering generally final products. The existing rates would be adjusted and subsumed in these two basic rates with some exceptions on account of WTO bindings or higher tariffs for agricultural products. In accordance with the road map, I propose to reduce the peak rate from 35 per cent to 30 per cent this year. I also propose to make some changes to take care of some current problems.
2003
External Liberalization
172. Rate rationalization and reduction of peak rates of customs duties has been an integral part of economic reform in the country. The economy has not only ‘weathered’ the removal of quantitative restrictions on imports and the reduction in customs-duty rates, but has responded by improving its competitiveness and demonstrating the inherent strength of its external balance of payments. As a part of this continuous process, and in line with the pronouncements made by several of my predecessors, I now propose to reduce the peak rate of customs duty from 30 per cent to 25 per cent, excluding agriculture and dairy products.
2004
119. Now, I turn to my indirect tax proposals. The policy signal that needs to be reiterated is that customs duties will be brought down in a measured way. It is my intention to align India’s tariff structure to those of ASEAN countries. Eventually, there should be a uniform rate of tax on goods and services. During the last four years, my predecessors had adjusted excise duties and moved them towards a central VAT rate. That process must continue. The most important goods in the manufacturing sector must therefore bear an excise duty of 16 per cent.
120. Another principle that requires to be emphasized is that where an excise duty is levied, subject to only a few exceptions, like goods when imported should attract an equivalent countervailing duty (CVD). In my tax proposals, I have, therefore, removed the exemption from CVD enjoyed by some imported goods where there is no corresponding exemption from excise duty on India-made goods.
121. I may also point out that customs tariffs and excise duties are interrelated. While considering the tax regime for any sector, one must look at both customs duties and excise duties applicable to that sector.
122. The peak rate of customs duty was reduced to 20 per cent in January 2004. I propose to maintain the peak rate for the rest of the current fiscal year.
2005
112. I intend to advance the government’s declared policy of making the customs duty structure closer to that of our East Asian neighbours. Therefore, I propose to reduce the peak rate for non-agricultural products from 20 per cent to 15 per cent.
2006
120. In line with the government’s policy of reducing customs duties, I propose to reduce the peak rate for non-agricultural products from 15 per cent to 12.5 per cent. I believe that we are now only a short distance away from East Asian rates.
2007
126. In January 2007, the government announced wide-ranging reductions in tariffs. Import duties on capital goods, project imports, metals and specified inorganic chemicals were reduced by 2.5 percentage points and, in some cases, by 5 percentage points. Duties on some edible oils were reduced by 10 to 12.5 percentage points.
127. In order to take one more step towards comparable East Asian rates, I propose to reduce the peak rate for non-agricultural products from 12.5 per cent to 10 per cent.

FOREIGN AND SECURITY POLICY FOR A RESURGENT INDIA

Foreign Policy in the Wake of Economic Reforms: New Options and Friends
Shivshankar Menon
Adjustments and changes to India’s foreign and security policies made in the early nineties have been continued by successive Indian governments, irrespective of their ideological preferences and domestic bases of support. India has redirected, retooled and reinvented her foreign policy, making new friends and exploring new strategic options.
India’s burst of internal economic reform in 1991 coincided with a fundamental shift in international geopolitics. The collapse of the Soviet Union, the end of the Cold War and the demise of the bipolar world it had spawned saw the dawning of the US’s moment in history as the sole superpower, her unipolar moment. We, in India, saw a unique conjunction of domestic economic crisis and international phase transformation opening up new possibilities and options for our foreign and security policies. Fortunately for us, we had a leadership that was ready to use crisis as an opportunity to remake the practice of India’s foreign policy in the light of the changed situation, while keeping constant the pursuit of India’s core interests and strategic autonomy and agency in the international system. In effect, since 1991, India has redirected, retooled and reinvented its foreign policy, making new friends and exploring new strategic options. While this may be clear and obvious with hindsight, it was P.V. Narasimha Rao, Manmohan Singh and J.N. Dixit’s genius and, later, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Jaswant Singh and Brajesh Mishra’s perspicacity, to see the broader picture despite the fog of contemporary events, narratives and counter-currents, and to act on it.
  In some ways, the reform of India’s foreign policy by Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao, Finance Minister and, later, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, and Foreign Secretary J.N. Dixit in 1991–96 was as thorough as the Nehruvian groundwork of the 1950s to cope with the bipolar Cold War world. But where Nehru wrote on an essentially blank slate and could count on solid domestic support, Rao could not. What they both had to cope with was a rapidly changing uncertain world as they laid the basis of future Indian foreign and security policy.
  In effect, the end of the bipolar world in 1989 liberated India’s foreign policy, creating space for new approaches and relationships that had been excluded by the rigidities of the Cold War. Of course, as with any great change, not everyone saw them as an opportunity. While most younger Indian diplomats and the top political leadership saw opportunity for India, there were also those, mostly older diplomats—the Cold War iron had entered their soul—who saw the changes as a threat to long-established and comfortable ways of dealing with the world. It was the simultaneity of the international changes (with internal economic crisis and the reforms they made inevitable) and the fundamental nature of the geopolitical changes around us that made thoroughgoing reform of our foreign policies possible and gave us the licence to explore new options.
  The new freedom that Indian diplomacy enjoyed was first visible in the country’s relationship with the US and, simultaneously, with China; in the new economic diplomacy that domestic reform required; in the establishment of diplomatic relations with Israel; and in the expansion of functional exchanges with Taiwan.
  With the US, the initial Indian reaction to the February 1991 Gulf War followed Cold War patterns: India was supportive of Saddam Hussein and sought a negotiated peace. This was largely because India’s own polity was in flux, with short-term and unstable minority governments until P.V. Narasimha Rao’s government came to power in June 1991. India’s initial reaction to the 19 August 1991 coup attempt in Moscow by elements of the old Soviet order also seemed to suggest limited understanding of how much the world had changed. However, economic reforms, liberalization and Rao’s pragmatism—reflected in the decision to establish diplomatic relations with Israel in January 1992—were welcome evolutions in Indian policy from the point of view of the US. The liberalization and opening of the Indian economy bore immediate fruit in US–India trade, which almost tripled in the decade after 1991, from about $5 billion to $13.4 billion in 2001. It is also in this period that meaningful defence exchanges with the US and counterterrorism cooperation with the West began. American, British and French counterterrorism experts were invited to India for the first time after the 1993 Mumbai blasts, to see for themselves the evidence of Pakistani complicity in cross-border terrorism. This was, therefore, the period when the ground was prepared for the transformation of India–US relations under the subsequent Clinton and Bush administrations with the NDA-I and UPA governments, a bipartisan effort in both countries. The US no longer judged India through the Cold War prism of ‘with us or against us’, while India began removing the Pakistan incubus from India–US relations after the 1993 United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) meeting, when the US began to start accommodating core Indian national interests and acknowledging her concerns.
  Rao realized the centrality of the US in the new situation and worked to overcome the detritus that the relationship had collected over several decades of mutual indifference. His was a subtle mind and complex approach. He began serious talks with the US on nuclear issues, the essential differences which had led to US sanctions against India after the May 1974 nuclear explosion and continued to poison the relationship for years. He simultaneously energized the nuclear weapon and missile programmes, making it possible for the new NDA government to carry out the nuclear weapons tests of 1998 within two months of coming to power. It was the space opened up by the new geopolitical situation that enabled India to explore these options. But with new possibilities came new complexities. The media has reported that pressure from the US prevented India from carrying out another nuclear test in 1993 when US satellites detected preparations at the test site at Pokhran.1 One theory, however, suggests that this was part of signalling, that Rao wanted the preparations discovered, both to signal India’s possession of nuclear weapon ready devices and to gain time to develop thermonuclear weapons, which were not yet ready. In doing this, he was also able to oblige the US in practice by postponing the tests and to begin a serious dialogue on nuclear issues with the US from a position of strength. The full truth of Rao’s private calculations will never be known, but the theory matches the known facts. Evidently, the new situation after 1991 opened several policy possibilities in sensitive fields, which had not existed before.
  For the US, the liberalization and opening up of India’s trade and investment policies and the dismantling of the rigid industrial licensing system was clearly of great interest. It changed India’s stake in the international economic order in fundamental ways. According to the World Bank, India’s merchandise trade as a percentage of GDP in 1990 stood at 15.2 per cent (compared to China’s 38.4 per cent). By 2014, this proportion was 49.6 per cent (higher than China’s 41.5 per cent in the same year). This increase required changes in India’s external behaviour, a thorough revamping of the Government of India’s machinery, and moving the focus of much of our diplomatic work to economic diplomacy. As India became increasingly integrated into the Western liberal globalized order through trade and investment, economic diplomacy became an increasingly important task, multilaterally in the WTO and elsewhere where the rules for the future were being drawn up in the Uruguay Round and bilaterally, with the major economic powers, with new and vital partners, and with India’s neighbours. India timed her reforms right, caught the international globalization wave, and achieved over twenty years of unprecedented growth, ending up as the greatest beneficiary after China of the open global trading and investment economy from 1989 to 2008.
  What also helped change the US’s perception of India was the Rao government’s January 1992 decision to open an embassy in Israel. India had recognized Israel immediately after its creation in 1948 (by a UN resolution that India voted against because we were against the UN partitioning a country by fiat). While Israel had a consulate in Mumbai from then onwards, India had not opened a diplomatic mission in Israel, even though relations had extended to critical military supplies and regular ministerial, intelligence, economic and development exchanges since the 1950s. India had even faced an eight-day Saudi oil embargo in 1974 for its continued dealings with Israel. When the Rao government decided to open the embassy in Israel, it did so with considerable diplomatic finesse—before the Madrid process had made it politically easy—and with a public blessing by Yasser Arafat of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
  Manmohan Singh and Rao were among the first to see the other logical consequence of the new economic focus of our diplomacy. When Rao announced in Tokyo in April 1992 that India would ‘Look East’, the choice of place and time were both deliberate and prescient of the shift of economic and, ultimately, political power to the Asia-Pacific. The Kaifu government in Japan had been helpful during the worst of our economic crisis and Japan was, in Manmohan Singh and Narasimha Rao’s minds, a critical partner and pole of a Look East policy that sought also to leverage complementarities with ASEAN, Vietnam and South Korea—the last a country that Rao was the first Indian prime minister to visit. Primarily economic in its initial presentation, the Look East policy had implicit political overtones, which soon became apparent as the 1990s progressed and India began defence cooperation and other forms of political engagement in the region.
  The beneficial effect of shifting geopolitics was also immediately apparent in India–China relations. For China, the collapse of the Soviet Union removed the glue that had held together her quasi-alliance with the US since the Nixon visit in 1972. Added to this were fears in the Chinese leadership that they would be the next target of US attempts to fell communist regimes, at a time when internal fragility in the communist party and society was glaring after the Tiananmen killings of June 1989. China was therefore open to Indian suggestions to legalize the status quo on the disputed border, setting in place measures to maintain peace and tranquillity, and military confidence-building measures in the Border Peace and Tranquillity Agreement that was signed during Prime Minister Narasimha Rao’s September 1993 visit to Beijing. Equally, China moved to a relatively neutral position on India–Pakistan issues, with President Jiang Zemin advising the Pakistan National Assembly in his address to them in 1996 to do with India what China was doing: discuss the difficult and divisive issues, but not let them prevent cooperation in other fields such as the economy. The proof of this shift came in 1993 at the UNHRC, when China and Iran joined others in urging Pakistan not to press her resolution on Kashmir, which was ultimately defeated. The shift was confirmed in 1999 when China joined others in stressing the sanctity of the LOC in Kashmir when Pakistan violated it in the Kargil area, provoking a short, sharp war with India.
  We had also been in touch with Taiwan during our economic crisis when they had indicated willingness, for the first time, to enter into a purely economic relationship with India, without political symbols or complications. This was a time when China, uncertain of the US’s attitude after the fall of the Berlin Wall and needing a period of calm to restart reforms in 1992, was also reaching out to the Taiwan authorities. As a result of our quiet diplomacy on both sides of the Taiwan Straits, we became the only country with a long-established embassy in the People’s Republic of China to open an office staffed by diplomats in Taiwan without provoking a political reaction from Beijing. Today, Taiwan’s trade with India is over $7 billion a year and Taiwanese investment in India continues to grow.
  It took some years for India’s other immediate neighbours in the subcontinent to recognize the changed priorities of India’s neighbourhood diplomacy in the post-1991 emphasis on separating the economic integration of South Asia from settlement of bilateral political differences and the pursuit of mutual economic gain bilaterally. Sadly, whether the changed approach has credibility in the subcontinent is still an open question twenty-five years after reform began. Negotiations on a South Asian Free Trade Area were slow to begin and gather pace, even after India changed its mind and indicated its willingness to attempt one. The first beneficiaries of the new approach were, therefore, neighbours with more open minds, such as Bhutan and Sri Lanka (with whom the Free Trade Agreement was proposed and negotiated over a three-year period from 1997, with three Indian governments).
  After a slight lag, there was also a new realism in policy towards Myanmar, moving away from unthinking support of democratic elements and the cutting of all ties to calibrated engagement with the military regime—a policy that better served India’s security interests in a neighbour where Indian insurgents had found sanctuary, and that was our only land route to the East which was the focus of future policy.
  A similar realism was evident in the Rao government’s reaching out to Iran, putting aside any ideological discomfort with the theocratic nature of the regime, to cooperate pragmatically in Afghanistan (where both worked against the Taliban through the Northern Alliance), in meeting India’s energy needs, and in building an economic relationship that benefited both. Iran’s moderation and support to India’s concerns internationally were noticeable.
  If the new situation opened up space for India, it also did so for other countries. Pakistan, for instance, used the space created by the collapse of the Soviet Union and the conversion of the anti-Soviet Afghan War into a civil war to attempt to push their proxy, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, and his Hizb-e-Islami into power in Afghanistan. When it became clear that he could rocket Kabul but not take it, Pakistan created the Taliban and supported them militarily and financially to bring them to power in Afghanistan. It took considerable time, domestic crises in Pakistan, other failures such as Kargil (a conflict in which their traditional allies supported the sanctity of the LOC and not Pakistan’s effort) and the failure of cross-border terrorism in the 1990s to detach Kashmir from India, to convince the Pakistan establishment that they needed to be seen attempting to come to terms with India. In the immediate aftermath of reforms, India’s Pakistan policy had to cope with exaggerated Pakistani notions of the efficacy of jihad and the mujahideen as instruments of state policy. India’s approach, therefore, was essentially indirect and defensive, countering terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir and ensuring that Pakistan’s traditional supporters did not endorse her efforts in Kashmir and the UN. This the Rao government was successful in doing, both with the US and even, to a considerable extent, with China. In the UNHRC in 1993, Pakistan, misreading the international situation, found China, Iran and the US working against its attempts to internationalize Jammu and Kashmir, and traditional allies in the Afghan jihad, such as Saudi Arabia, distinctly lukewarm. Pakistan’s support to Hekmatyar and the Taliban in Afghanistan, her nuclear weapons programme and proliferation, and the risk she posed to the beginnings of India–US and India–China rapprochement had contributed to this outcome.
  For our part, we sought nothing more at this stage from Pakistan’s traditional supporters than counsels of restraint and lack of support for Pakistan’s sponsorship of cross-border terrorism and its attempts to create war crises to internationalize the Kashmir issue. That we were able to obtain.
  The other challenge for India after 1991 was to stabilize India’s relations with a hurt and angry Russia, with whom defence and strategic ties remained critical to India’s security. This was not easy when Russia itself was not certain of the directions it was exploring under Boris Yeltsin, when the extent of the changes in Russia and India were still unclear, and when India was diversifying its strategic relationships and sources of weapons procurement to include France and other Western countries. Legacy issues, like settling the balances left by rupee–rouble trade, were relatively quickly settled as both sides wished to move on. While the relationship was preserved better than most other countries in similar positions with Russia, the real flowering of a strategic relationship had to await the coming to power of President Vladimir Putin in the next decade.
  One larger problem, never adequately addressed by Indian policy or the EU amidst the burst of Western triumphalism after the fall of the Soviet Union, was that of building a new relationship with a Europe that was redrawing boundaries in the East; uniting Germany; spreading NATO to Soviet borders and India’s neighbourhood in Afghanistan; and embarking on the highly ambitious European integration project, opening internal travel through the Schengen and starting a monetary (but not fiscal) union in the euro. From a policy point of view, India continued to look at Europe primarily as an economic factor and not as an independent political actor. Hence, the focus on India–EU economic arrangements, most recently the still inconclusive Broad Based Trade and Investment Agreement—inconclusive because there seems to be no political impulse behind it in either India or the EU. Strangely, Europe was trying to become an independent pole and actor on the global stage, just when the end of the Cold War meant that the East–West divide, and therefore Europe, was no longer central to global politics. So, just when its geopolitical weight and significance diminished, Europe was seeking to play an independent role in the world, without the support of the sole superpower or its own most powerful members. This is a conundrum that India and the Europeans have still not solved to this day.
  It is possible to argue that the end of the Cold War also reduced the sole superpower’s interest or commitment to stability maintenance everywhere and in all cases around the world. A Kosovo or Bosnia would have been inconceivable between 1948 and 1989. This was also evident in the nuclear domain, where the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) was made permanent, using legal means rather than relying on direct political intervention by the superpowers—as in the past—to maintain their nuclear weapons monopoly. Pakistan exploited the opportunity created by the US distractions to speed up its nuclear weapons programme; China continued testing in anticipation of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) in the 1990s; and the CTBT itself was written in convoluted ways to force India into the straight-jacket of becoming a non-nuclear weapon state. India had been threatened with nuclear weapons in the past and had complex relations with four of the five nuclear weapon states recognized by the NPT. For India to be without nuclear weapons when both her neighbours, China and Pakistan, had them would have been politically intolerable for any Indian government.
  The 1998 decision by India to overtly become a nuclear weapon state can also be seen as a direct consequence of these geopolitical shifts and the international stakes that India had developed in the early 1990s as a result of reform. Those same stakes created by reform also ensured that, unlike the long-lasting sanctions that followed the 1974 explosion, normalcy was restored to most of India’s relationships in about two years after the 1998 tests.
  It is worth asking how fundamental a change in India’s strategy was the Rao government’s 360-degree reworking of India’s foreign policy and seizing of opportunities with the US, China, Japan, Israel, Taiwan and others. Prime Minister Rao always denied that there was a fundamental change, saying that he was merely implementing what Nehru had laid down and completing what Rajiv Gandhi had begun. This was an understandable stance when domestic opposition was strong within his own party and from the Opposition BJP, which later carried these policies to their logical conclusion when they came to power towards the end of the decade. Rao led a minority government and had to build coalitions to stay in power, and the claim to continuity certainly made easier the task of holding his flock together and finding allies.
  But the fact remains that, in several respects, the new foreign policy differed from what had been followed earlier: sometimes reflexive anti-Westernism in the late 1970s; seeing the North–South divide as central to international relations from the late 1960s onwards; and an occasional separation of foreign policy from India’s development imperatives. The new willingness to acknowledge reality on the border with China, to recognize the essentiality of the US to India’s aspirations, and to seize new opportunities to India’s east and in Israel and Taiwan were certainly path-breaking, no matter how well masked as continuations of past policy.
  Rao was convinced that the conduct of foreign relations on a transactional basis, like haggling over potatoes, was ill-suited to a civilizational entity like India, and that we needed to look at individual regions and countries not through peepholes but with our doors thrown open. This conviction governed his approach to the US, China and Russia, with differing individual results but none that diverted him from his beliefs. Rao’s prioritization of countries on the basis of how each might influence India’s core national interests never devalued those who might not figure equally prominently in this categorization. Witness, for instance, the weight he placed on our strategic ties with the newly independent former Soviet republics of Central Asia.
  At the broadest level, however, Rao was right about his foreign policy carrying on a legacy. There was truly continuity in India’s foreign and security policies after the 1991 economic reforms. The pursuit of strategic autonomy (as it was soon to be called), consolidation of the nuclear weapons programme, and India’s growing international options and agency were actually the essence of nonalignment tweaked to fit new circumstances. What had not changed was the substratum of policy or its ideological underpinnings: the consciousness that India’s was a unique situation, necessitating that India take care of its own security and prosperity, using the external world and shaping it when it could. Rao married his ambitious striving for strategic autonomy with domestic economic liberalization as a reinforcing element—a combination that provided, he felt, the synergy sought by a nation whose international role was not at the time fully serving its national interests.
  To the West, neo-liberalism seemed to have won in 1989 and was presented as the correct way to organize the world. But from India’s point of view, with so many poor people and at our stage of development, neo-liberalism might have some utility but was hardly a panacea. Rao pronounced his prescription of a ‘middle path’ in global economic growth—where the siren songs of material progress would not drown out the appeals of the less fortunate—at the Mecca of the neo-liberal consensus, the Davos World Economic Forum. Of course, it was primarily a neo-liberal world that we had to come to terms with. While parts of the new Russian establishment embraced this ideology—with disastrous domestic results—India, like China, used parts of it, while keeping reservations close and preserving domestic policy space and autonomy. This was most evident in India’s stance at the Rio Earth Summit in June 1992, which negotiated the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Rao was also concerned about the effects of the unilateralist and sectarian course advocated in the UN and elsewhere as part of the neo-liberal consensus under the guise of ‘preventive diplomacy’ or ‘humanitarian intervention’. His misgivings led him to urge a note of serious caution bilaterally and in multilateral appearances and, in retrospect, have been proved correct in North Africa and the Middle East.
  Nor was there a change in the fundamentally realist view of the world inherited from Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by Prime Minister Rao and his successors in the UPA government, particularly Manmohan Singh. None of them were taken in by claims of a ‘new world order’ or expected existing power holders to willingly share power or adjust international institutions to recognize new economic and power realities and accommodate India. That, it was clear, would have to await the accumulation of economic, political and military power by India, and its transformation into a strong, prosperous and modern country.
  On balance, therefore, Rao’s reforms of Indian foreign policy, like all great and successful reform, was as traditional as it was inventive and as empathetic as it was pragmatic, reworking tradition where necessary and going well beyond it. He pragmatically concentrated on the opportunities opened up by geopolitics while flagging but effectively postponing world order issues, such as a seat on the UN Security Council for India.
  The fact that the adjustments and changes to India’s foreign and security policies made in the early 1990s have been continued by successive Indian governments, irrespective of their ideological preferences and domestic bases of support, suggests that the foreign policy prompted and made possible by the 1991 reforms represented a remarkably wise set of policy choices, despite being made in the midst of the fog and confusion of a world in fundamental change. In essence, it is still Rao’s vision of a re-invigorated India retrieving a place of dignity and worth in a fast-changing, sometimes erratic, often unpredictable world that drives Indian foreign policy. The foreign policy reforms of the early 1990s are worth studying for what they teach us about dealing with fundamental phase change in the international system. For today, again, the international system is undergoing a fundamental transformation before our eyes: the US’s unipolar moment is being challenged by a rising China; the globalized world economy is being fragmented and is shrinking or sluggish; and, populism, demagoguery and authoritarianism are on the rise everywhere. At the same time, the economic optimism and hope of the early 1990s seems far, far away from the post-2008 crisis prospect and the world of today. There is much that we might learn by looking back to the early 1990s as we contemplate an uncertain future.

Navigating the Post–Cold War Landscape: India’s Rise in a Contested Geopolitical Space
Shyam Saran
We have entered a new phase of renewed great power rivalry and incipient confrontation, which presents India with a more complex and polarized international environment. The more successful India is in sustaining economic reforms and accelerating its growth, the more it will be able to expand its regional and global profile.
The adoption of far-reaching economic reforms and liberalization by India in 1991 was a historic development, which also had a significant impact on the country’s foreign policy. This was a year when India grappled with two coincidental crises. One was the economic crisis related to the balance-of-payments deficit, and an unprecedented threat of default and bankruptcy. The other related to the sudden collapse of the Soviet Union, with which India had shared a long-standing strategic partnership rooted in a shared perception of threat from China and which had also provided significant support for India’s pursuit of self-reliant economic growth. Dealing with the twin crises led to a major reorientation in India’s foreign policy. In order to understand these changes, it may be worthwhile to examine the geopolitical setting prevailing at that time.
  The end of the Cold War in 1990 and the collapse of the Soviet Union brought about a dramatic and seismic change in the geopolitical landscape, which had been relatively stable since the end of the Second World War. It marked the emergence of the United States as a hyper-power, and the bipolar international order gave way to a unipolar moment dominated by it. The collapse of the Soviet Union also meant that the ideological competition between authoritarian socialism and liberal democracy appeared to have been settled in favour of the latter. Liberal democracy and free markets became the new orthodoxy enshrined as the Washington consensus. It was accepted as self-evident truth that societies embracing capitalist–style market economies would inevitably gravitate towards liberal democracy. This certainly was a widespread expectation regarding China but was rudely belied when, in June 1989, Chinese authorities put down, with a heavy hand, the pro-democracy demonstrators who had gathered in their thousands in the historic Tiananmen Square at the heart of the Chinese capital, Beijing. This marked the end of the Western romance with China since Nixon’s famous visit to Beijing in 1971. It also marked the end of the virtual alliance between the US and China against the Soviet Union. There was now no common adversary to ally against. As China continued to rise and challenge American power in the Asia-Pacific region, a resurgent India began to be seen as a potential partner in keeping the power balance stable in the region. To the extent that India’s new and outward-looking economic policies required support from the advanced economies of the West, the changed geopolitical environment provided opportunities that Indian diplomacy was able to leverage. The scope of India’s external engagement expanded rapidly, often beyond the human resource and intellectual capacity to manage it.
  The economic crisis that compelled the embrace of economic reform and liberalization opened the doors to the globalization of the Indian economy. While seeking to build its own economic and security capabilities, India had to look for other options to counter the continuing threat from a rising China. Several of the post-1990 initiatives derive from these unanticipated compulsions. Relations with the US and the European Union (EU) began to improve and expand as China’s rise began to appear threatening to its erstwhile sponsors. India’s accelerating economic growth and its relatively more outward-looking economic strategies began to project it as the next big commercial opportunity after China. Economic and security drivers also pushed India to re-engage with its East Asian neighbourhood. The Look East policy, not coincidentally, was adopted in 1992 and it wasn’t long before the Asia-Pacific region became one of the most dynamic components of India’s external economic relations as well as a target for more robust security engagement. The emergence of the US as a hyper-power masked the steady shift in the centre of gravity of the global economy from the trans-Atlantic to the trans-Pacific. This was not only because of the emergence of China but also, in time, of India as rapidly growing, continental-sized economies. Indian foreign policy began to reflect this change, and this was nowhere more apparent than in the steady intensification of India’s relations with ASEAN. From a sectoral dialogue partner, India successively became a full dialogue partner in 1992, a summit partner in 2002 and finally a strategic partner in 2012. An emerging India with significant military capabilities, in particular, maritime capabilities, was welcomed as a countervailing presence to the expanding Chinese security footprint in the region. This intensification in relations had a politico-security aspect as well as a significant economic dimension. The political dimension was reflected in the regular meetings at leadership level. India also became active in the Asia Regional Forum which focused on regional security issues. It became a founder-member of the East Asia Summit and was invited to join the ASEAN Defence Ministers’ Meeting (ADMM). India and ASEAN have since entered into a Free Trade Agreement, which now covers goods, services and investment. They are currently negotiating the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). The RCEP brings together the ten ASEAN countries plus six of its summit partners, namely, Australia, China, India, Japan, Republic of Korea (RoK) and New Zealand. India has also applied for membership of the Asia-Pacific Economic Community, which could well become the platform for a future trans-Pacific Free Trade Area. This could become a rival to a now stalled US-led Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), from which both India and China have been excluded.
  It will be apparent that India has consciously tried to integrate itself both politically and economically with its eastern neighbourhood. It has readjusted its diplomacy to accord greater priority to the Asia-Pacific region and pay attention to economic links as being equally important as political relations. However, the level of integration achieved to date is much lower than China’s. India-ASEAN trade has attained a level of $70 billion against a target of $100 billion in 2015 and is likely to remain stagnant over the next few years. The investment picture, on the other hand, is better with a progressively larger volume of FDI flows in both directions. Indian companies are invested heavily in Singapore, which serves as a hub for India’s economic interaction with the region. Singapore is also a major investor in India with over $30 billion in cumulative FDI. The India-Singapore Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, which concluded in 2005, has played a major role in boosting trade and investment ties between the two countries.
  The nuclear weapon tests in 1998 and the declaration of overt nuclear weapon status by India was only a temporary setback in this reorientation of major power relationships in the post–Cold War era. Within barely two years after the tests, President Bill Clinton paid India a well-publicized visit. In 2005, the perception of strong long-term strategic convergence with India led the US to acknowledge—though implicitly—that India’s acquisition of a nuclear deterrent was now a permanent reality and should no longer stand in the way of forging a strong strategic partnership. The Indo-US nuclear deal of July 2005 was made possible against this backdrop. Military exchanges and a new defence hardware relationship with the US also emerged at about the same time, even though Russia continued, and continues, to be a significant source of defence technologies and hardware. It was not lost on India, however, that since the end of the Cold War, Russia and China had moved much closer together and that Russia was supplying much the same advanced hardware to China as it was to India. It was the US that neither supplied weapons to China nor allowed the Europeans to do so.
  In retrospect, India was relatively successful in responding to a complex political and economic challenge after the Cold War. In less than a decade, it had reoriented itself to a vastly transformed international landscape and began to leverage its newfound engagement with a different constellation of major powers to support its continuing task of nation-building.
  The post–Cold War international environment endured, by and large intact, for a quarter of a century up until the global financial and economic crisis erupted in 2007–08. As a result of the virtual monopoly of power enjoyed by the US, there was relative calm in great power relations. Neither Russia nor China were inclined to confront the United States, even if there were perceived transgressions of their interests. On regional issues—such as the conflict in the Balkans, the Afghan War and the invasion and occupation of Iraq, during the decade of the 1990s and the first decade of the current century—China and Russia often acquiesced in the unilateral assertion of US power. On certain issues, such as the Iranian and the North Korean nuclear programmes, there was a degree of coordination and cooperation among the major powers. This created the illusion that the end of the Cold War had inaugurated a new phase in history, where there was no sharp ideological conflict among the major powers, that all such powers had accepted the logic of capitalist market economics and were ready to cooperate in managing cross-cutting challenges whose salience had increased in an increasingly globalized and interconnected world. The norms of global behaviour laid down by the Western democracies were deemed to be undisputed and universal in application. From a Western, in particular, US, perspective geopolitics had receded to the background, the probability of major power conflict had diminished and the prospects of major power cooperation on managing the global commons and dealing with regional and global challenges had significantly improved.
  Of course, geopolitics had never gone away from the perspective of non-Western powers. If anything, geopolitical contestation had become sharper in West Asia and the Gulf, in several parts of Africa and in our own South Asian neighbourhood, in particular, the Afghanistan–Pakistan theatre. From the perspective of Japan, RoK and South East Asian countries, the rise of China and its increasing assertiveness raised new fears and tensions. Thus, when the US and West Europeans now speak about the ‘return of geopolitics’, it is from a much narrower Western perspective. Geopolitics has made a comeback because the unipolar moment that prevailed over much of the twenty-five-year period after the Cold War has come to an end. Rival powers such as Russia and China are no longer constrained to acquiesce in the US definition of the global order. The global financial and economic crisis has severely dented the ideological orthodoxy enshrined in the Washington consensus. The US and, in particular, Western Europe, find themselves on the defensive; their own social and economic institutions are under heavy and sometimes, as in the case of Greece, debilitating stress. In many instances, it is the Western countries that are most guilty of violating their own solemnly upheld norms.
  For India, the quarter of a century that followed the end of the Cold War was a benign phase and generally supportive of its economic advancement and conducive to its pursuit of its security interests. With the exception of China, the other four members of the Security Council joined hands in 2008 to enable India to obtain a waiver from the Nuclear Suppliers’ Group (NSG) and allow it to access the international nuclear energy market. China eventually acquiesced because of this overwhelming support for India among the major powers, including middle powers such as Brazil, Mexico and South Africa. Today, the situation is different with a more confident and assertive China willing to be the last man standing in preventing India’s membership of the NSG.
  Similarly, all major powers supported India’s permanent membership of the Security Council, even though for some it was more of a rhetorical than a sincere commitment. In the Asia-Pacific, India’s rise was welcomed. India’s relations with the countries of South East Asia and the Far East reflect this new perspective about India. India–Japan relations have witnessed a thorough transformation driven both by the common perception of Chinese threat as well as mutual economic opportunities. As the attractiveness of the Chinese market has begun to dim and Chinese military assertiveness worries Japan, India has emerged as a preferred partner. Japanese companies, encouraged by the Japanese government, have finally begun to see India as a major investment destination.
  The 9/11 terrorist assault by al-Qaeda on the United States in 2001 also brought about a significant change in international attitudes towards cross-border terrorism, which could earlier be pursued by Pakistan with impunity under the guise of supporting a ‘freedom movement’. Pakistan could no longer rely upon the US and international ambiguity to indulge in state-sponsored terrorism against India or embark on adventurist actions on the LOC, such as the Kargil war in 1999, and escape opprobrium. This was an important gain for India and a collateral benefit of the global war on terrorism unleashed by the US. In particular, after the 26/11 terrorist outrage in Mumbai perpetrated by Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba operatives in 2008 and the subsequent assassination of the al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden in 2011, hiding in plain sight in the Pakistani cantonment city of Abbottabad, Pakistan has earned the unenviable reputation of being the breeding ground of Jihadi terrorism. India and the US today have a level of counterterrorism cooperation, including against Pakistan-based terrorism, which would have been unthinkable even a decade ago. So, from this perspective, the decline of geopolitics for the US and the West helped India deal more successfully with its own geopolitical challenges. This benign phase that provided a generally supportive international political and economic environment for India’s rise may now be coming to a close, as sharper contradictions come to characterize the evolving relations among the major powers. China has taken advantage of the relative passivity of the US under a domestically preoccupied Trump administration to enhance its own regional and global profile. With protectionism on the rise in Western economies and the virtual demise of the US-led TPP, China has projected itself as the new champion of globalization, free trade and open economies. Its ambitious One Belt One Road (OBOR) initiative has given it both economic and geopolitical traction. This was visible at the recent Belt and Road Forum convened by Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing (14–15 May 2017) to formally launch the initiative, but which India chose to stay away from. In making the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which runs through Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (POK), the centrepiece of the OBOR, China not only chose to ignore Indian sensitivities but also provided a political and security shield to Pakistan, which has emboldened the latter to up the ante against India. Thus cross-border terrorism has taken on a new intensity as have hostile actions against India—for example, the decision to execute an alleged Indian spy, Kulbhushan Jadhav, a former Indian naval officer. India thus confronts a more complex security situation in its neighbourhood, which also acts as a constraint in the expansion of its regional and global profile.
  This new phase of geopolitical competition may be traced to the global financial and economic crisis of 2007–08, from which neither the US nor Europe have fully recovered, although the US appears to be in better shape today than its Western allies. The persistence of this crisis has meant that the relatively open and liberal trading environment in the West, which allowed the export-driven economies of China and East Asia to flourish and to emerge as major manufacturing platforms supplying the global market, is now under threat. In responding to sluggish growth and shrinking markets, both the US and the Western economies are resorting increasingly to protectionist measures using non-tariff barriers, such as imposing environmental or labour standards or stricter regulatory standards. For India, which adopted economic reforms and liberalization comparatively late, these protectionist trends come at a time when there is a renewed effort to establish India as a globally competitive manufacturing hub. ‘Make in India’ will not enjoy an international economic environment as supportive as China, since it began its own market-oriented reforms in 1978. The US-led TPP in Asia-Pacific and its initiative for a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) threatened to create a vast trading zone with restrictive norms and standards, designed to keep away competition from countries like India, which otherwise enjoy comparative advantage. The erstwhile votaries of free trade became its most serious violators. India confronted the risk of being pushed to the margins of the global economy. However, the TPP is no longer possible with the withdrawal of the US, its main sponsor. For the same reason, the TTIP too has become a distant possibility. This may bring some relief to India, but as we have seen, the Trump administration is adopting increasingly restrictive trade policies. There is particular danger to the Indian IT industry as a result of limits placed on the issue of H-1B visas. These steps also render the strategic partnership between India and the US unstable and unbalanced. For a strong partnership, both the economic and security pillars must be strong and mutually beneficial.
  As pointed out earlier, the global financial and economic crisis has altered major power relations. Europe has turned inwards and remains preoccupied with multiple crises. Its economies remain stagnant, even as social stresses and strains begin to spawn ultra-right and xenophobic sentiments across the continent. Extremism among its deprived Muslim communities is becoming a worrying threat. These negative trends may worsen if economies continue to stagnate and unemployment remains high. In 2004–05, India and the EU forged a very strong strategic partnership based on their shared values of multi-ethnic, multicultural, multi-religious and multilingual plural democracies. Each side had a stake in the success of the other and India looked upon a strong, united Europe as a pole of its own right in the global order. That has changed in the past decade, thanks to the Eurozone crisis, which has muted the voice of Europe in international affairs. The crisis has also led to the independent power and influence of Germany, which is now indisputably the strongest power in Europe. This has its own implications for the future of Europe. Some analysts see the crisis in Ukraine as a not too subtle attempt by the US and the UK to rein in Germany and retard its growing engagement with Russia. There is no doubt that the West is divided over how to deal with Russia. Few wish to return to the dangerous tensions of a renewed Cold War in Europe, but there is also legitimate apprehension over Russian intentions.
  Both in Europe as well as the US, we are witnessing a wave of anti-globalization and anti-immigrant sentiments, which is also tinged with rising xenophobia. This has already manifested itself in the positive popular vote in June 2016 supporting ‘Brexit’, or Britain’s exit from the EU. It is also manifest in the election of Donald Trump as President of the US in a presidential election campaign marked by open advocacy of regressive and insular policies with relentless demonization of immigrants. These negative trends will adversely impact India’s economic prospects, in particular, its expanding IT services exports.
  For India, the Ukraine crisis that erupted in 2014 and led to a serious worsening of relations between Russia and the West has introduced a new element of discomfort as it seeks to maintain its residual relationship with Russia, without impacting its growing partnership with the US. It is also uncomfortable over the tightening embrace between Russia and China, which can only work to India’s disadvantage. In provoking the crisis over Ukraine, the US does not appear to have thought through its incompatibility with its pivot to Asia, which is directed towards countervailing growing Chinese power. In the US–China–Russia triangle, it is China that now holds the levers, not the US as hitherto. The Trump presidency initially seemed to promise an improvement of relations between the US and Russia, but allegations that Russia may have interfered in the US election process and that there were unreported contacts between Trump’s campaign staff and Russian officials appear to have frozen any prospect of easing tensions between these two major powers. This can only reinforce Russian dependence on China for political and economic support.
  The Ukraine crisis has become interlinked with another recent trend— that of falling oil prices. The sharp and unexpected fall in oil prices is attributed to over-supply, particularly from shale oil production in the US. However, there is a geopolitical element here as well. There appears to be a tactical understanding between the US and Saudi Arabia, which is the most influential ‘swing’ producer of oil, to drive oil prices down in order to penalize Russia as also to put pressure on Iran, both of whom depend heavily on oil revenues for their economic well-being. The current glut in the oil market is a temporary phenomenon. The growth in demand for oil is currently 1 million barrels of oil per day, but the extent of replacement of declining oil production in existing fields is about 5 million barrels per day. Furthermore, each barrel of replacement oil is more costly to produce. Therefore, most analysts expect that oil prices are bound to rise sooner rather than later. Therefore, if Russia can tide over its current crisis over a year or two, which appears likely, then it will re-emerge as a key energy player again with all the influence that this could bring to it.
  The implication of this for India is that it should not assume a prolonged decline in oil prices in drawing up its long-term energy strategy. However, this temporary phase of low prices should be leveraged to reform energy subsidies, acquire oil and gas assets abroad at more favourable prices and continue with a long-term strategy to bring about an accelerated shift from its current reliance on fossil fuels to an economy based progressively more on renewable and clean sources of energy such as nuclear energy.
  India’s energy security concerns are nevertheless currently tied to the situation unfolding in the Gulf and West Asia. Any major political upheaval in the region is likely to interrupt energy supplies to India, with negative consequences for our future prospects. The diversification of supply sources away from the Gulf is, therefore, an urgent necessity as is the need to ramp up domestic production. The Iran nuclear deal, arrived at in early 2016, has been one positive development in an otherwise bleak landscape in the region. It has opened up new opportunities for India in one of the most important countries of the Gulf. The Modi government has also undertaken bold new initiatives to upgrade India’s relations with the Gulf countries, including Saudi Arabia and the UAE, the two countries that are both key oil and gas producers and that also play host to a substantial Indian diaspora.
  Another related contingency to plan for is the impact of any political turmoil in this region on the welfare of the over 6 million Indians who live and work there. As was apparent during the abduction of Indian nurses and workers by ISIS in Iraq, expat Indians are very vulnerable to shifting political changes in the region, and India has few instruments of influence available among countries in the region. The evacuation of a few hundred Indians during a crisis is a major operation. If larger numbers are affected, India’s own resources can be easily overwhelmed.
  The other dimension to consider is the sharpening of the sectarian divide in the region and its fallout on our own Muslim population. There is also the need to carefully study the attraction of ISIS for young Muslim men and women across the world, including India. While ISIS is described as being medieval in its mores and conduct, its appeal for young men and women appears to lie in, paradoxically, the opportunity it offers to break away from the conservative and repressive code of traditional Islam. For young women living together as ‘temporary wives’ of ISIS fighters, this can be a liberating experience rather than a relapse into repressive medievalism. This aspect has somehow been missed in the discourse over ISIS. Asking conservative family elders to warn their children against the barbarity and un-Islamic conduct of ISIS is unlikely to work, if the point of attraction lies elsewhere. It is by encouraging a more liberal and accommodating Islam, such as that which prevailed before Wahabi influences crept into the subcontinent’s Muslim societies, that the lure of ISIS may be confronted.
  If there is one geopolitical crisis that could derail India’s prospects and impact its social cohesion and plural culture, it is the very real likelihood of the current turmoil in the Gulf/West Asia spreading to the sheikhdoms and to Saudi Arabia. Planning for this contingency should be a priority in our national security strategy.
  One does not envisage much change in India’s China strategy. It will continue to be a mix of both engagement and competition, with a precise mix varying according to the changes in the regional and global situation. There was an expectation that with both India and China now being headed by strong leaders, Narendra Modi and Xi Jinping respectively, there may be a window of opportunity to seek a political resolution of the long-standing boundary dispute. This has not happened. The key question is on what terms and conditions the dispute could see resolution. To be politically acceptable in India, it would have to be a Line of Actual Control (LAC) plus solution. China’s current posture does not appear to hold out a possibility of such an agreement in the foreseeable future. There is also the lingering issue of Tibet, which hangs over the relationship. Therefore, managing the dispute through confidence-building measures, reducing its salience in the overall relationship and continuing the practice of regular engagement at the summit level will all contribute to the relationship remaining stable despite its essentially competitive underlay. A strong set of diversified relationships with major powers, in particular, the United States, gives India greater room for manoeuvre vis-à-vis China rather than provoking its hostility. As long as India refrains from becoming a member of an anti-China military alliance, China has more to gain by increasing its engagement with India than by confronting it. It is inevitable that each side will continue to develop relations with the other’s neighbours. For India, the strategy has to include delivering on the stated priority to our subcontinental neighbourhood so that we do not leave spaces that China or others can take advantage of.
  India and China have expanded their cooperation in areas of convergent interests. As members of BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) and now of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), China and India have platforms for closer economic and political engagement. India decided to join the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) launched earlier this year by China and the two joined hands to launch the BRICS Development Bank, which is headed by an Indian. These new financial institutions could become important sources of finance for India’s own infrastructure development.
  India confronts a new challenge in the OBOR initiative launched by China, which seeks to invest the country’s surplus capital in creating modern transport and communication infrastructure and logistic hubs linking Asia and Europe both through the land and maritime routes. On the one hand, such infrastructure would also be available to India for its own expanded regional and global economic engagement. On the other hand, once in place, OBOR will also substantially reinforce China’s security reach. Nearer home, the CPEC, which is part of OBOR, traverses POK, which India claims as its sovereign territory. This has already led to tensions both with Pakistan and China, and India declined to attend the recent launch of the OBOR in Beijing.
Main Trends to Watch Out For: The Way Ahead
One, we have entered a new phase of a renewed great power rivalry and incipient confrontation, which presents India with a more complex and polarized international environment. This could limit the country’s room for manoeuvre but may also create opportunities for India to expand its own strategic space. The more successful India is in sustaining economic reforms and accelerating its growth, the more it would be able to expand its regional and global profile.
  Two, the global financial and economic crisis, which still has to run its course, has made the international economic environment less supportive of India’s development ambitions as compared to the two decades following the end of the Cold War. Protectionist trends are gaining strength, which may marginalize India and push it to the periphery of the global economy. While external trade and investment will remain significant, the key drivers for growth may have to be domestic. The adoption of GST is a significant reform, creating a more integrated national market for the first time.
  Three, India could face a major crisis as a fallout of intensified political turmoil and sectarian conflict in the Gulf and West Asia, with few levers available to influence events. This would be in the nature of a more immediate challenge. Managing the rise of China would qualify as a more long-term challenge. The country needs an overall strategy to cope with both these security challenges.
  The key asset that India could leverage is its potential to emerge as the world’s fastest growing major economy as China’s own growth decelerates. A period of sustained and high rate of growth would enable India to move towards the centre of the global economy from the margins and be able to negotiate from a more favourable position. This would also expand India’s options in its foreign relations both in the region of Asia and beyond. This was certainly our experience in the aftermath of the adoption of the first generation of reforms, particularly in the peak growth years of 2004–07. India’s economic performance and its undoubted potential for accelerated growth in the future enhanced its foreign-policy options. Conversely, when the growth trajectory slumped in the subsequent years under the impact of the global financial and economic crisis of 2007–08 and several missteps in the management of the economy thereafter, India’s regional and global profile too diminished. It is only after the election of Narendra Modi as prime minister in 2014 and the expectation of far-reaching second-generation economic reforms that there has at least been a perceptional change about India’s economic prospects and its potential to play a greater role regionally as well as globally. These second-generation reforms need to be directed towards the market pricing of resources, the elimination of regulatory and bureaucratic rigidities and creating a predictable, efficient and market-friendly economic environment. India needs a steady infusion of capital and modern technology to sustain high rates of growth, and this is where foreign policy can create new opportunities as well as support expanded economic engagement with potential partner countries.
  India’s growing economic and security profile finds greater acceptance regionally and globally, as it is perceived as a non-threatening and benign power. This is a major advantage compared to China, whose rise is already creating anxiety and concern both in its periphery as well as among major powers. India must continue to retain this perceptional advantage through diplomacy.
  The priorities set forth by the Modi government and the initiatives it has taken so far reflect some of these elements. There are no major departures from the direction set by the previous governments in the post–Cold War era, but there is a more determined and energetic pursuit of the objectives set forth already. There will, however, be the need for some course corrections and fresh initiatives as the international environment becomes a more contested space and the frequency and salience of regional and resource-related conflicts increase.

Security and Sovereignty in an Open Economy: New Thinking after 1991
Sanjaya Baru
The 1990s brought about an important shift in the thinking on national security: India started viewing power in economic rather than military terms.
The year 1991 marked a turning point for India, but not just on an economic front. In that landmark year, there was also a shift in thinking regarding the role of defence spending in national security and, more importantly, the relative importance of development and human (social and economic) security in national security and stability. In 1991, the Republic of India was still a young nation, having been constituted less than half a century earlier. Much policy attention was still focused on national security and integrity. Many new nations formed in the middle of the twentieth century had not survived their teething years. The Soviet Union was on the verge of collapse, despite having emerged as one of the post-war ‘superpowers’. In the midst of a fiscal and balance-of-payments crisis, India learnt its lessons quickly.
  At least three factors contributed to the new thinking on national security. First, the fact that the fiscal and balance-of-payments crisis of 1990–91 was in part triggered by a sudden increase in defence spending and defence imports in the second half of the 1980s; second, the implosion of the Soviet Union under the weight of its economic weaknesses, partly on account of excessive investment in defence and inadequate investment in economic capabilities; and third, the incipient rise of China, based on a more open economic model, mimicking the export-led industrial strategy of much of East Asia.
I. Defence Spending and the 1991 Crisis
In the 1950s, when the country’s focus was on economic development and the government of Jawaharlal Nehru did not apprehend any major external threat to national security—despite the early provocation by Pakistan in Jammu and Kashmir—defence spending remained modest. It was less than 2 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) through the 1950s. The border conflict with China in October 1962 forced India to increase its defence spending. In the three years following the conflict, defence spending averaged 3.5 per cent of GDP. Over the next two decades, from 1966 to 1986, the annual average defence spending to GDP share remained around 3 per cent, in the range of 2.75 to 3.25 per cent. In the three years after that, it once again exceeded 3.5 per cent of GDP, rising to a high of 3.59 per cent in 1987–88, and then fell below 3 per cent. It has remained well below that over the past two decades (see Table 1).

Government of India (various years).
The spike in defence spending in the mid-1960s and in 1971–73 was in the context of the India–China and India–Pakistan wars of 1962, 1965 and 1971. The spike in the 1980s was partly because of the Sri Lanka campaign. However, a significant factor that contributed to an increase in the mid-1980s was the decision to undertake a major programme of defence modernization.1 Hence, the increase in public spending translated itself into increased imports. The sharp increase in gross fiscal deficit of the central government as a percentage of GDP from the Sixth Plan (1980–85) average of 6.3 per cent to 8.3, 9 and 8.1 per cent in 1986–87, 1987–88 and 1988–89 respectively was at least in part due to increased defence spending, especially defence imports.2
  While many analysts, including the authors of the ministry of finance’s annual Economic Survey, would refer to rising defence spending as a factor contributing to higher deficits and government debt in the 1980s, the paucity of data and lack of closer attention meant that few would draw pointed attention to defence spending as an important contributor to the fiscal and balance-of-payments crisis of 1990–91.3
  It was left to Amit Bhaduri and Deepak Nayyar to observe in their critical review of the policy initiatives of 1991: ‘The problem [of government deficit] was aggravated by a spending spree on defence, particularly in the second half of the 1980s. According to the International Peace Research Institute at Stockholm, during this period India topped the list of developing countries (including oil-rich countries like Saudi Arabia and Iraq) in defence spending.’4
  Interestingly, in his lengthy and historic budget speech of 24 July 1991, the then Finance Minister Manmohan Singh devoted considerable time to justify reduced spending on various subsidies and explain the importance of fiscal rectitude, but made no mention at all of the problem of defence spending and his decision to bring it down. However, in effect he did. As Table 1 shows, the share of defence spending in GDP and total central government expenditure was kept at levels significantly below those recorded in the preceding two decades.
  While Singh did not explain his decision to the Parliament, he did make one interesting remark at the end of his long speech. The policies of the Narasimha Rao government, he claimed, would ensure ‘the emergence of India as a major economic power in the world’.5 To view power in economic, rather than military, terms was an important shift in the perception of national security and strategy that the 1990s brought about. This thinking was, of course, necessitated by the fiscal crisis and the consequent shortage of funds for defence.
  However, its intellectual lineage was impeccable. The relationship between sound fiscal management and responsible defence spending was captured in Kautilya’s Arthashastra, over 2000 years ago, wherein Kautilya observed, ‘from the strength of the treasury, the army is born’.6 All translations into English use the word ‘strength’ rather than ‘size’. The ‘strength of the treasury’ is what later-day economists would term ‘fiscal empowerment’ or ‘fiscal stability’. Defence spending is a necessary but insufficient condition for national security. Given that it is dependent on the ‘strength of the treasury’, fiscal prudence along with high economic growth becomes the precondition for national security, enabling the fiscal empowerment of the nation.
  In his analysis of the economic foundations of power, historian Niall Ferguson7 defines the ‘square of power’ as being constituted by four elements, namely, a tax-collecting bureaucracy; a representative Parliament; a national debt; and a central bank. Fiscal and monetary policies define the economic foundations of a country and its ability to project power. The focus of macroeconomic and fiscal management in 1991, and immediately thereafter, was, therefore, on bolstering the ‘strength of the treasury’. Funding the army, so to speak, would have to wait.
  Indian defence analysts have long argued that given the relatively high defence expenditure to GDP shares of China and Pakistan (over 5 per cent in both countries in the 1990s), India’s long-term average of less than 3 per cent was inadequate and the National Security Advisory Board (NSAB) recommended in 1999 that the government should maintain an annual average share of at least 3 per cent in the medium to long term, for India to keep pace with the defence spending of its adversaries.8 In the event, actual defence spending has been well below 3 per cent of GDP. While it remains at fiscally manageable levels, two views may be taken on the issue.9 It can be argued that the benchmark figure of 3 per cent of GDP was constructed in the 1990s, when Indian GDP was still growing at close to 6 per cent per annum, while in the period after 2003, the rate of growth was higher, at an average of over 8 per cent. The below 3 per cent spending still represented higher allocations in absolute terms. On the other hand, the critics of this view argue that if the government had set aside 3 per cent of GDP for defence spending, then more funding would have been available in the 2000s.10 Much the same could be said for spending on other priorities such as education and health, where too spending has been below 3 per cent of GDP.
II. 1991 Lessons from the Cold War
The macroeconomic policy shift was also aided by the fact that in the debate on ‘guns vs butter’, or ‘defence vs development’, the verdict of the Cold War was that countries that had invested in butter and development had emerged as more secure nations than those that had invested mainly in guns and defence.
  Even before the implosion of the Soviet Union had become inevitable, the rise of Germany and Japan as ‘geoeconomic’ powers—if not geopolitical players—also showed that military might was a condition neither sufficient nor necessary for political stability and economic well-being. The socialist economies of Eastern Europe and Eurasia had invested heavily in defence and nuclear capability. Yet, none of the militarily powerful states were able to survive the challenge posed by their economic and political weaknesses.
  On the other hand, post–Mao China had, under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping, opted for a different course, opening up the economy and focusing on economic development. Deng blew the dust off Zhou Enlai’s ‘four modernizations’ of 1963 and launched, in 1978, his own revolution for the modernization and transformation of China. The modernization of agriculture, industry, national defence, and science and technology were Deng’s four priorities. Deng’s assumption of power was preceded by a rapprochement between the People’s Republic and the United States of America. This altered the Cold War balance of power across Eurasia and the Asia-Pacific region. Not only had India’s strategic environment been altered, but Indian attitudes towards nation-building and modernization began to change too.
  Economic policy analysts in India have not paid adequate attention to the impact that the collapse of the Soviet Union and the rise of China have had on India’s views on economic and national security policy. The Nehruvian economic model of state-supported, import-substituting industrial development was hugely influenced by the Soviet experience.11 India’s export-pessimism derived from this worldview. When some of Asia’s smaller nations began to rise on the basis of an export-led model of industrialization, Indian policymakers often took the view that the experience of ‘city-states’, such as Hong Kong and Singapore, and small nations, such as Taiwan and South Korea, were not relevant for a large continental economy like India.
  China’s switch to the Dengist economic model of more outward-oriented industrialization and the emphasis on international trade and the development of comprehensive national power began to change attitudes in India. In his televised national address on 9 July 1991, after his announcement of the first round of trade liberalization, Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao said:
India has much to learn from what is happening elsewhere in the world. Many countries are bringing in far-reaching changes. We find major economic transformation sweeping large countries like the Soviet Union and China . . . There is a change in outlook, a change in mindset everywhere. India too cannot lag behind if she has to survive, as she must, in the new environment.12
The change in thinking on the role of external economic relations in national development reflected a more fundamental change in thinking about the idea of ‘self-reliance’, national security and global interdependence. Most postcolonial nations in Asia, Latin America and Africa viewed external economic relations as imposing a burden on their developmental aspirations. This thinking defined the views of the ‘Dependency School’ in development economics. Across the developing world, the strategy of inward orientation was defended on the grounds that it preserved the independence of newly liberated nations, reduced dependence on colonial and imperial powers, and afforded a free economic and political space within which these new nations could grow. In social sciences literature, this spawned such radical schools of thought as the ‘Dependencias’, influenced by the work of Raúl Prebisch, Andre Gunder Frank, Immanuel Wallerstein and Samir Amin. The ‘dependency theory’ viewed the global economy as an integrated system in which countries at the ‘centre’ or the ‘core’—the developed OECD economies—derived undue benefit from their economic interaction with the countries on the ‘periphery’—the developing economies. The underdevelopment of the latter was intrinsically linked to the development of the former. It was a zero-sum world.
  The new view on economic policy shifted the focus from the idea of ‘dependence’ to that of ‘interdependence’, and insisted that such economic interdependence offered greater national security. Increasingly, the view held was that several newly industrializing economies, including large economies such as China, had been able to increase their political leverage in international affairs, both in bilateral relations and in multilateral forums, by increasing their share of world trade, particularly their trade relationship with the United States and other major OECD economies. Economic relations acquired a new political dimension in the age of pragmatism in foreign policy. No country has been able to demonstrate the power of commerce in diplomacy better than Dengist China. India followed with a lag.13
  While India has been slow to re-integrate with the world economy, it has, to its credit, moved consistently in that direction. India’s share of world merchandise trade went up from 0.5 per cent in 1990 to 1.5 per cent in 2015. More importantly, India’s average applied tariffs on manufactured goods went down from 145 per cent in 1990 to 10 per cent in 2014 and on all goods from 144 per cent in 1990 to 13.5 per cent in 2014. Consequently, the share of trade (exports and imports) in goods and services in GDP increased from 17 per cent in 1990 to 54 per cent in 2014.
III. Quantifying National Power and Security
Taken together, these developments influenced thinking at the highest levels on national security planning. By the end of the decade, in 1999, the ‘Economic Security’ chapter of the Strategic Defence Review (SDR) prepared by the NSAB of India would open with the proposition:
Economic power is the cornerstone of a nation’s power in the contemporary world. The economic size of a nation matters and is an important element of national security. Low economic growth, low productivity of capital and labour, inadequate investment in human capital and human capability and a reduced share of world trade have contributed to the marginalization of the Indian economy in the world economy. The economic security challenge for India is to pursue above average national income growth at the annual rate of at least 7 per cent to 8 per cent so that India’s share of world income is commensurate with her population size and a larger economic base can more truly reflect India’s global status.14
This shift in focus away from a narrow view of national security, defined by military spending and defence capability, to a wider economic perspective was also in step with the new thinking on ‘comprehensive national power’ (CNP) popularized by the China Academy of Social Sciences (CASS). CASS developed a measure of CNP, defining it as a weighted average of military, economic, scientific and technological capability. The eight variables used were: natural resources (weight of 0.08), domestic economic capability (0.28), external economic capability (0.13), scientific and technological capability (0.15), social development (0.10), military capability (0.10), government capability (0.08) and foreign affairs capability (0.08).15
  The Chinese CNP indices calculated for the year 1985 showed the United States at the top, followed by the Soviet Union; China was seventh and India in eleventh place (see Table 2). The Chinese CNP index had a profound influence on strategic thinking in India and spawned several attempts at constructing similar indices.16
  Based on this idea and drawing on the thinking of the NSAB’s SDR 1999, analysts at India’s National Security Council Secretariat developed the Indian National Security Index. The SDR defined the concept of economic security thus:
It implies political and economic sovereignty and autonomy of decision-making, albeit in an increasingly inter-dependent world characterized by the ‘globalisation’ of economic activity. It implies the assurance of economic well-being and social justice as reflected in particular by generalized access to food, clothing, shelter, education and employment. It implies the acquisition of skills and knowledge aimed at acquiring technical and technological capabilities required for sustained and self-reliant economic development and assured defence capability.17

The SDR summed up the new thinking thus:
National security encompasses more than national defence and internal security. Its foundation must rest on the social and economic well-being of the people. A socially fractious, economically backward and politically divided nation is unlikely to be militarily secure. Military security is a necessary, not a sufficient condition for national security.18
These ideas have since been taken forward by the National Security Council (NSC) and the Ministry of Finance. The NSC commissioned the construction of what has been termed the National Power Index (NPI).19 The NPI was constructed as a weighted average of six quantifiable variables: economic capability (25 per cent), military capability (25 per cent), population capability (15 per cent), technological capability (15 per cent), energy security (10 per cent) and foreign affairs capability (10 per cent). That the national security establishment had internalized the idea that economic, technological and human capabilities taken together ought to have a weighting of at least 50 per cent in the NPI, compared to 25 per cent for military capability, stands testimony to the change in thinking on national security in India.
  The construction of the NPI spawned several attempts to arrive at a definition of what constitutes national power and sovereignty in a globalized world of increasing interdependencies. At the ministry of finance, Chief Economic Adviser Kaushik Basu led a research team that constructed what has been called the Index of Government Economic Power (IGEP).20 The IGEP, composed of four variables, namely, government revenues, foreign currency reserves, export of goods and services, and human capital, is based on the idea that ‘the power of a government is its economic power’.21
  Basu et al. claim, ‘These variables broadly reflect aspects that contribute to a government’s economic clout, voice and negotiating leverage by capturing elements like its ability to raise resources, its creditworthiness and credibility in international financial markets, its influence on global economic activity and its potential in terms of human resources.’ Arguing that the idea of ‘economic power’ gained greater importance following the end of the Cold War and the advent of globalization, the authors of IGEP lay particular emphasis on the importance of government intervention and support in post-crisis economies.
The global economic crisis witnessed governments playing a crucial role in stabilizing financial markets and managing to coordinate responses in order to prop up the world economy. In the wake of the crisis, governments continue to play a vital role in terms of economic management and welfare oriented activities. Governments also play a critical role as agents of redistributive equity and development. Therefore, the economic power of governments is a matter of great significance.22
Country-wise index numbers were estimated for the years 2000 to 2009 and ranking was done for 100 countries. The United States remained at the top, both in 2000 and 2009. China replaced Japan in second position over the decade, while India moved from the eighth to the fifth rank (see Table 3).
  Geopolitical developments in the post–Cold War era have only underscored the point that competition between nation states is increasingly in the economic realm and the idea of national power is increasingly linked to economic rather than military power. Military conflict has not been able to resolve any major geopolitical contest, while the global balance of power is increasingly being determined by geoeconomic phenomena.23

IV. Post-Pokhran Sanctions and Liberalization
That this new thinking has been internalized across the national political spectrum was demonstrated in the aftermath of the Pokhran-II round of nuclear weapons testing in May 1998. Having declared India as a nuclear weapons power, the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government immediately declared a policy of ‘no first use’ and reached out to friendly countries seeking their understanding of India’s national security interests. Faced with economic sanctions imposed by important economic partners, including by USA, Japan, Australia and some European economies, as a response to the nuclear tests, India chose to reach out to them with the message that it sought a mutually beneficial economic relationship with them, that it was forced to conduct nuclear tests in defence of its long-term security, and that it would not pursue a belligerent strategic posture in its neighbourhood. Having unilaterally declared that its nuclear doctrine would be based on the principle of ‘no first use’, India consciously reduced its defence spending over the next several years, focusing instead on the fiscal sustainability of economic growth.
  After Pokhran-II, the government deputed non-official delegations to travel to USA, Germany, Japan and other countries with this message. I was part of a non-official delegation constituted by the director general of the Institute of Defence Studies and Analysis, which comprised retired diplomats and research scholars who travelled to Washington DC, Paris and Tokyo to explain India’s national security challenges and strategy. I was asked to make presentations on the business opportunities India offered and on India’s commitment to a liberal economic order, to draw attention to the fact that India seeks a mutually beneficial economic relationship with developed economies.
  By taking this step, the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government demonstrated its recognition of external economic liberalization and the creation of relationships of ‘interdependence’ as an important element of a national security strategy. This relationship manifests itself in two ways: first, increased foreign trade and investment creates benign webs of interdependence and mutual benefit with the outside world; second, it extends to the rest of the world the cost of a crisis in India. While trade economists generally emphasize the purely economic and ‘rational’ reasons for trade liberalization, political economists and strategic policy analysts must also appreciate the ‘foreign policy’ and ‘strategic’ dimension of external liberalization.
  In the quarter century after 1991, India has not only remained an active participant in multilateral economic institutions, it has also woven new webs of interdependence with all major powers, including China, and with a large number of Asian nations. It has also kept defence spending to a minimum, not allowing it to overwhelm the finance ministry’s fiscal stabilization agenda.
  In more recent times, India’s ‘strategic partnerships’, entailing defence pacts, have also included economic agreements. The Joint Statement issued by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Barack Obama in June 2016—‘The United States and India: Enduring Global Partners in the 21st Century’—in which ‘the leaders affirmed the increasing convergence in their strategic perspectives and emphasized the need to remain closely invested in each other’s security and prosperity’ is the product of this thinking.24
  While the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been viewed by many critics as being hyper-nationalistic in its orientation, there has been no change in the thinking about the fiscal sustainability of defence spending. Defence expenditure as a percentage share of GDP remains well below 2 per cent of GDP and nowhere near the 3 per cent level recommended as an ideal ballpark figure in SDR 1999. India remains committed to its ‘no first use’ nuclear doctrine and the Modi government has vigorously pursued closer economic relations with both Western and Asian economies, including China and Pakistan. The 1991 shift in the view on national security in an open economy still endures.

India’s Governance Challenges: Why Institutions Matter
Sarwar Lateef
The economic reforms of the past twenty-five years have transformed the country in many ways but India’s institutions have failed to keep up with these changes. Sarwar argues that unless India invests in its institutions, it cannot take for granted the high growth rates it is experiencing.
The major transformation that India has experienced in twenty-five years of economic liberalization has left its key governance institutions behind. This chapter reviews the strengths and weaknesses of Indian governance in the context of a rapidly growing economy, liberated from a regime of controls and state domination. It focuses on a few core institutions, principally at the national level, which are critical to good governance. It does not attempt to review governance at state and local levels, where these challenges are equally, if not more, severe.
I. Economic Liberalization and Institutional Reforms
The 1980s and 1990s saw a wave of economic liberalization reforms in the developing world. These typically included fiscal, financial, trade and exchange-rate reforms, opening up to FDI, privatization and deregulation. By the end of the 1990s, with most reforming countries showing relatively poor results, there was increasing recognition of the neglect of institutions in these initial reform programmes.1 A number of studies emphasized the importance of addressing institutional reforms. Institutions, it was argued, played a key role in creating, regulating, stabilizing and legitimizing markets.2
  India’s 1991 reforms were no exception. Institutional reforms were largely ignored with two important exceptions. First, financial liberalization was accompanied by efforts to strengthen the regulatory framework to improve prudential norms, capital adequacy standards and external supervision. Second, capital-market reforms were accompanied by the establishment of a modern regulatory framework under a new Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).
  Governance formally entered the official vocabulary in the Tenth Five-Year Plan (2002–07) prepared under the NDA, which saw it as a ‘cornerstone’. ‘Weak governance’, it argued, ‘manifesting itself in poor service delivery, excessive regulation, and uncoordinated and wasteful public expenditure, is seen as one of the key factors impinging on growth and development’.3 The Plan document also stressed the importance of a market-based economy of law and order, the sanctity of contracts, and the speed with which they were enforced. This recognition came late in the life of the NDA government’s term.
  Manmohan Singh, prime minister of the UPA government that came to office in 2004, echoed the same concern in his first address to the nation: ‘No objective in this development agenda can be met if we do not reform the instrument in our hand with which we have to work, the government and public institutions’.4 And indeed, there were a number of governance initiatives during the UPA’s first term, including the establishment of the Second Administrative Reforms Commission (ARC), the passage of the transformative Right to Information Act and a number of e-governance initiatives, including the Unique Identity ‘Aadhaar’ Card. Ironically, the second term of the UPA government was marred by major corruption scandals reflecting regulatory failures; the nexus between corrupt politicians, civil servants and crony capitalists; and the perennial need of political parties for election finance. All these issues are discussed below.
II. The State of Indian Governance
The authors of the Indian Constitution bequeathed to independent India a document that has largely stood the test of time. Under its benign influence, a democratic experiment has flourished that is quite unique in this world. Many of the institutions it created have taken root. The citizens of India, and particularly its poorest, have demonstrated a faith in the democratic process that is profoundly touching. They take their duty as voters seriously and each election demonstrates their good sense and their capacity to send strong messages to their leaders. So, it is important that the country’s leadership and its elite do not betray this trust.
  The economic reforms of the past twenty-five years have transformed the country in many ways and demonstrated its immense potential. India is richer, more urbanized, better integrated economically, and better connected. But, as noted above, India’s institutions have failed to keep up with these changes. So, while the country, in terms of per capita GNI, is fourfold richer since 1990 and has been making considerable progress in social indicators, in 2015, it is still ranked 138th in terms of per capita GDP and 130th on the UN’s Human Development Index. Its citizens continue to experience significant failures in the delivery and quality of the services the state provides in such critical areas as health, education, and law and order. Some 283 million citizens over the age of six remain illiterate,5 and 21 per cent of its population is below the poverty line.
  Underlying India’s crisis of governance is a steady deterioration in its institutions, which began in the mid-1970s following Indira Gandhi’s state of Emergency, and has continued largely unchecked. This is reflected in India’s low ratings on international governance indicators, but its principal symptoms, defined broadly, are widespread corruption, failures of quality and quantity in service delivery, deterioration in the rule of law and the related progressive weakening of institutions of restraint.
  The importance of reversing this deterioration in institutions cannot be overstated. India has quickly transitioned from low-income to lower-middle-income status. As Gill and Kharas argue, governments in a middle-income country must manage several important transitions.6 As a market-based economy, India will need to enable a smooth entry and exit from sectors as comparative advantage shifts.
  Industrial policy must facilitate greater technological sophistication, and ensure both an adequate supply of skilled labour and a high-quality managerial and technical output from universities to meet increased demand. Public regulation of infrastructure and natural resources must balance the interests of citizens and investors, and public–private partnerships must be managed with greater transparency and effectiveness. Governments must also learn to effectively manage the growth of cities as urbanization rates increase. They must ensure that public policy addresses income and asset inequalities. And above all, they must ensure the rule of law, enforcement of contracts and speedy dispute resolution. All these call for high-quality public institutions. Unless India invests in its institutions, it cannot take for granted the high growth rates it is experiencing.
III. The Accountability Triangle
The social contract implicit in the Constitution calls on citizens to elect its representatives to national, state and local legislatures. These legislatures, in turn, elect a government from amongst their ranks that runs the administration, empowering civil servants to collect revenues and provide a range of services that citizens expect from it, including law and order, health and education. An accountability chain, which runs from citizens to elected officials and from elected officials to civil servants and service providers, links these three sets of players in what constitutes an accountability triangle. How accountability works in practice is discussed below, focusing on a few key institutions: the Election Commission, political parties, Parliament, the civil service, the police and the judiciary.
• Citizens and Their Elected Representatives
Election Commission
India’s reputation as a liberal parliamentary democracy has been greatly boosted by the effectiveness with which its Election Commission conducts elections. The 2014 elections involved an electorate of 834 million, of which 553 million, some 66 per cent, exercised their vote in almost 1 million polling stations, requiring some 5 million personnel to conduct the elections. That elections on this massive scale in twenty-nine states and seven union territories are conducted, by and large peacefully, every five years, in what is seen as a free and fair process, and that their results are rarely questioned, is a hugely impressive achievement. But as the Commission frequently argues, the process would be even freer and fairer if the political will existed to address the significant criminalization of politics, the huge sums that are expended by candidates to fight elections well above the specified limits under the law, and the inability to better manage electoral rolls and prevent ‘political parties and influential persons to manage large-scale registration of bogus voters, or large-scale deletion of names of “unfriendly” voters’.
Political Parties
The problems faced by the Election Commission in establishing a freer and fairer process reflect the unwillingness of political parties to subject themselves to a reform process that would better demonstrate the intent of the Constitution. The three key problems facing political parties are (i) criminalization (ii) lack of transparency in the way elections are financed; and (iii) lack of inner-party democracy.
  These problems are not a result of economic liberalization, but they have grown worse over the years. The 1993 Vohra Committee report on criminalization pointed to the clear ‘nexus between the criminal gangs, police, bureaucracy and politicians’ and the fact that ‘some political leaders become the leaders of these gangs/armed senas and over the years get themselves elected to local bodies, State assemblies, and national parliament’.7 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, of 8214 candidates scrutinized by the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), 1405 faced criminal charges. Of these, 909 were serious, such as murder, communal disharmony, kidnapping and crimes against women. ADR found that the likelihood of being elected was greater for those facing criminal charges.
  Why do political parties nominate criminals? Duraisamy explains that their defence usually is that criminal charges are framed by opposing parties because of ‘animosity or revenge’. Criminal actions may have been undertaken on behalf of the party, and those charged are being rewarded for their behaviour. In some cases, these may be wealthy local businessmen who have broken the law. Those facing conviction may find it convenient to seek protection in parliamentary membership.8 But why do voters elect those facing criminal charges? While lack of awareness may often be used as an excuse, it is usually a more complex calculus in which caste, communal and party loyalties compete with charges of criminality.
  Although declared expenditures on elections are usually substantially below the limits prescribed by the Election Commission, it is an open secret that political parties depend heavily on black money and other illegal contributions that supplement the substantial legal contributions they receive predominantly from corporates as tax-deductible contributions. Dependence on legal and illegal political contributions creates obligations that must be met in terms of political favours while in office, a classic example of crony capitalism. Political parties have so far successfully resisted efforts by the Election Commission to have their audited finances disclosed to the public. Not surprisingly, as J.P. Narayan notes, ‘since power is a source of future wealth and income, it becomes an end in itself, not just [the] means to improve society for the public good’.9
  From a long-term perspective, the lack of inner-party democracy represents an even more serious failure. Party posts are not subject to democratic processes but to the whims and fancies of party leadership. In a political system based on feudal leadership styles, chief ministers of states that are larger than most European countries get appointed through consensus among a top coterie of political leaders sitting in New Delhi, and candidates for parliamentary and assembly seats are chosen through a highly opaque and murky process. This prevents a political market from emerging where leaders get elected by party members for their ability to deliver results as perceived by voters rather than by leaders who have themselves been chosen through an opaque process.
Parliament
Political parties determine the quality of Parliament. The average member of the Sixteenth Lok Sabha is older than was the case a decade or two ago, better educated (75 per cent of MPs have graduate degrees), and substantially richer: some 443 of 543 members (who are currently paid Rs 6,00,000 a year) are ‘crorepatis’ (those with assets exceeding Rs 10 million). The proposition that you get rich in politics is illustrated by the fact that the 165 MPs who were re-elected from the Fifteenth Lok Sabha saw their assets rise in nominal terms by 137 per cent to an average of Rs 128 million, albeit partly reflecting the high inflation rate and rise in asset prices over the five-year period (see Table 1).
  A disturbing trend, as noted above, is the steady increase in the number of MPs who face criminal charges, many of whom are in the ruling party. The percentage of MPs facing serious criminal charges (murder, rape etc.) has risen from 15 per cent in the Fifteenth Lok Sabha to 22 per cent in the Sixteenth. While it is easy to file First Information Reports (FIRs) and lodge criminal charges against any person in India—given a corrupt police force—the failure to frame and enforce rules that prevent criminal elements from seeking office, as suggested by several eminent committees, reflects the increasing dependence of all parties on such elements to win seats in legislatures.
  Parliament has also seen its productivity decline. While there are many outstanding members who are fully capable of engaging in debate, political parties have taken to using ‘unparliamentary’ tactics to disrupt proceedings and prevent discussion. Time spent on interruptions and adjournments due to disorderly scenes rose from an average of 9 per cent in the 1991–99 period, to 19–20 per cent in the 1999–2009 period, and 40 per cent in the 2009–14 period. Time spent on actual business declined steadily from 2528 hours in the Tenth Lok Sabha to 1345 in the Fifteenth (Lok Sabha Secretariat 2014).

Although there are several notable exceptions (such as some of the recent debate on the GST), Parliament has ceased to be a venue where the people’s representatives seriously debate issues or seriously review policy or Budget documents or reports prepared by parliamentary committees. Tolerance for other points of view has declined, and instead of reasoned discussion, the tactics of street warfare are used to oppose a particular legislation or to highlight issues of corruption. Much of this deterioration mirrors the sharp political divide that has emerged in many major democracies and the failure of political leadership of the ruling party, to take Parliament seriously and to seek and build consensus around reforms. Moreover, power has shifted to the Executive in most Westminster-style governments, and legislatures are weaker.
• The Executive Branch and Service Delivery
Citizens expect the government in power to provide them with basic services or to regulate the providers of such services. They also expect the government to enforce the rule of law and ensure law and order.
The Civil Service
The civil service plays a central role in delivering a broad range of services to citizens and helping elected representatives fulfil the social contract. ‘Government service’ is still seen as an avenue for personal advancement. Recruitment is through a highly competitive process. Some 3 million people apply each year—a four-fold increase over 1990—and a tiny fraction get in for the various services, with less than 100 securing admission in the prestigious Indian Administrative Services (IAS).
  Given the odds of getting in, the quality of intake is presumably high. Yet, ‘there is a widespread perception within and without the IAS that the average IAS officer’s ability to enforce the laws, rules and procedures, and to tender policy advice without fear or favour has declined dramatically, to the point where a large number of officers are perceived to routinely act at the behest of political or other interests in the performance of their routine (non-policy) work’.10 The legendary reputation for integrity has gone, and there is a further perception that there is extensive misuse of the officer’s official position to secure ‘pecuniary advantage’. There are undoubtedly many officers who choose to remain clean, but they tend to pay a heavy price for such integrity.
  Two principal problems plague the civil services: first is the relationship between civil servants and their political masters, and the second, and related, is the steady deterioration in the quality of internal management of the services.
  The National Commission to review the working of the Constitution describes the root problem in the relationship between the political executive and civil servants:
Arbitrary and questionable methods of appointments, promotions, and transfer of officers by political superiors also led to corrosion of the moral basis of (the civil service’s) independence. It has strengthened the temptation in services to collusive practices with politicians to avoid the inconvenience of transfers and to gain advantages by ingratiating themselves to political masters.11
The civil service is poorly managed. It is also grossly understaffed at the senior level, with Class A and B employees comprising roughly 15 per cent of the 3 million central government employees. A central issue, relating to political management, is the short average length of postings. In the 1978–2006 period, the average tenure of postings for nearly half of all IAS officers was less than one year, and for another quarter, less than two years. The impressive second ARC report found that training was grossly underemphasized, and its role in domain expertise and promotions was weak; there was a ‘glaring mismatch’ between required competencies for jobs and the background or training of officers; appointments lacked transparency and did not emphasize domain competence; performance management systems were weak and promotions were routine and automatic up to the joint-secretary level. Of these, the most serious issue, in a world of increasing technical complexity where governments in middle-income economies are required to manage complex transitions is the neglect of domain expertise in a service dominated by colonial-style generalists. As Rakesh Mohan notes, ‘civil servants may be field district officers one day and state or central government secretariat functionaries the next. Domain knowledge is then acquired on the job, but no sooner is it acquired than they are transferred to the next job’.12
  The three most important of the ARC’s many sensible recommendations were (i) to subject postings and transfers to a more transparent process, less prone to political interference, by establishing central and state civil service authorities, (ii) introducing a fitness bar after fourteen and twenty years of service to allow officers to be discharged for unsatisfactory performance; and (iii) introducing competition for joint-secretary-level appointments from all government services and for highly specialized assignments from outside the government. The Commission could have gone further and recommended opening up all joint-secretary positions, and some even more junior, for external competition to attract domain expertise from outside.
  The UPA failed to act on these important ARC recommendations. Public Interest Litigation (PIL) from retired civil servants resulted in the Supreme Court instructing states in 2013 to establish Civil Services Boards and a fixed tenure for all cadre posts, but state governments have largely ignored this. There are still highly talented and hardworking officers in the system. When the interests of political leaders coincide with the need to do the right thing—such as managing natural disasters, or the Kumbh Mela, or when officers report to the Chief Election Commissioner and manage elections—they do a first-rate job. Yet, this potential remains largely unrealized due to a failure to reform the system.
The Police
Nowhere is the contrast starker between the transformation that India has witnessed in the last twenty-five years and the state of its institutions than in the case of the police. The police are still governed by an 1861 Police Act. The colonial culture that produced this Act is alive and well today. Ruling political parties that use the police to further their own interests have replaced the colonial masters. As Ved Marwah, a retired police officer and former governor, notes:
Arbitrary interference in day to day functioning has played havoc with its organization and morale . . . The ruling parties are directly interfering in their recruitment, postings, transfer and promotions. Beholden to their political masters, the police take less interest in the difficult task of enforcing the rule of law and spend more time in serving their benefactors.13
This day-to-day interference includes the routine actions police take in arresting anti-social elements or acting on a court-ordered detention since their superiors come under pressure from politicians ‘who attempt to make capital out of every incident’.14
  Political interference apart, the police force faces three issues that are similar to those faced by the administrative services. First, it is poorly managed. Decision-making is highly centralized, both for personnel and for the resources needed to conduct investigations and perform basic tasks. Power is concentrated in the hands of the elitist Indian Police Service (IPS), which constitutes only 1 per cent of the police force. While much of the day-to-day work of the police is done by the middle ranks of inspectors and sub-inspectors, the SP (an IPS officer) calls the shots, and their chances of promotion and their ability to influence decisions are limited.15 Constables who account for 80 per cent of the police force are generally poorly educated, poorly paid, work long hours, and are treated shabbily by the officer class. They enjoy considerable powers of arrest, search and seizure, but lack the training and skills to exercise these powers without abusing them.
  India’s crime rates are low by international standards. Crime incidence rose in absolute numbers from 4.8 million in 1990 to 7.2 million in 2014, but fell modestly to 581 per 1,00,000 people over this period. This decline, however, has more to do with the failure to properly record crimes than an actual decline in crime rates.16 Politically managed data is part of the story of political interference and weak management.
  Second, the police are grossly understaffed. While the sanctioned strength is 2.26 million, there are half a million vacancies, resulting in an actual size of 1.72 million.17 In relation to India’s population, this is small, with 135 police per 1,00,000 people in 2013 as against 262 in Brazil, 367 in Mexico, 208 in South Korea and 225 in the UK (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime). India’s armed police has grown rapidly and is now roughly one-fifth of the sanctioned police force.
  Third, there is a growing mismatch between the skills and domain expertise needed for effective policing in a rapidly changing environment and a police force whose incentives are geared to primarily protect a ruling elite. The rule of law depends jointly on the judiciary and the police enforcing it. It is often equated with preserving law and order, but important as that is, the more subtle and difficult task is to ensure equality before the law, even for the country’s poorest and weakest. This is rarely understood. Beyond this basic function, a rapidly growing entrepreneurial and business class expects security for its enterprises. A growing middle class expects police protection from crime and harassment. A vibrant democracy brings demands each day to protect voters in elections, to ensure that demonstrations remain peaceful, and to provide security for political leaders. The growing threat of terrorism and social unrest requires high-quality intelligence and strong links with communities. The rapid increase in corruption and other white-collar crime calls for specialists in these areas. These multiple demands require a thorough modernization of the force.
  State governments have resisted pressure from Supreme Court rulings on PILs to reform the police. Law and order is a state subject, so the ability of central governments to bring about change in the police is limited. However, a reformist central government could pass a ‘Model Police Bill’ as suggested by the Supreme Court, and at least implement reforms in union territories and pressure states under their party’s rule to implement reform.
The Judiciary
The judiciary is among the most trusted of India’s key governance institutions. It has also become very powerful as a defender of the Constitution and a protector of citizens’ rights. It is active in exercising its powers of judicial review and entertaining PIL suits, particularly in enforcing the Directive Principles of the Constitution. It is often seen filling the vacuum created by failures of the Executive branch, in what is regarded by its critics as judicial activism. At the same time, the judiciary is also becoming progressively dysfunctional.18
  This dysfunctionality can be seen in the pendency of some 60,000 cases in the Supreme Court, some 3.9 million in the high courts and 27 million in the subordinate courts at the end of 2015 (see Table 2). The vast majority of cases have been pending for ten to fifteen years.19
  There are four principal reasons behind this massive pendency:
* First, the management of the court system has progressively deteriorated over the years. This is reflected in poor case scheduling, frequent rotation of judges, atrocious case management and judges agreeing too easily to requests from lawyers for postponements.
* Second, India grossly underinvests in its judiciary. There are only 17,000 judges, roughly a fourth of the number recommended by the 120th Law Commission Report in 1987 nearly three decades ago. The problem is further exacerbated by a large number of vacancies. The high courts, for instance, have some 470 vacancies against a sanctioned strength of 1079 judges. A severe shortage of courtrooms worsens the situation.
* Third, there appears to have been a deterioration in the quality of judges over time. While on average the quality remains high, poor pay, particularly relative to the high fees top lawyers command for each appearance, makes it unattractive for lawyers to want to join the judiciary. The blame also lies in a collegium system for selection of judges, which lacks transparency20 and is seen as relying too heavily on seniority and being too tolerant of weak and sometimes corrupt behaviour of judges. Efforts by the Executive to reform the system by creating a National Judicial Appointments Commission were blocked by a Supreme Court ruling that saw this as an encroachment on the separation of powers in the Constitution.
* Finally, the government adds to the backlog of cases by becoming what ex-Attorney General Goolam Vahanvati calls ‘a compulsive litigant’, filing appeals on ‘frivolous grounds’ in what is seen as an unholy nexus between civil servants and lawyers who ‘milch’ the government for legal expenses.21

The high pendency of cases results in unacceptable delays in enforcing contracts and property rights and in meeting citizens’ needs for criminal and civil justice. It rewards the rich and the more influential who can manipulate the system, and penalizes honest and poor litigants. It is time the state invested adequate managerial and financial resources in developing a modern judicial system that can cope with the demands for dispute resolution of a rapidly growing economy while also ensuring the rule of law for ordinary citizens. The judiciary on its part must ensure that the incentives facing judges are aligned with the need to reduce the pendency of cases. This, in turn, will require reforming the country’s bar associations and ensuring that lawyers play their part in reforming the system.
IV. The Guardians of Accountability
While the judiciary has proved to be the main guardian of accountability in India, the Constitution specified a number of other bodies that play a key role as checks-and-balances institutions, such as the Election Commission, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Attorney General, and the Union Public Service Commission. In addition, there are a number of other statutory bodies such as the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC), the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and the Lok Pal. With the exception of these statutory bodies, where the leader of the Opposition participates in the high-powered committee to select the chairperson, the President, on the advice of the prime minister, appoints the three constitutional posts. While for the most part these constitutional posts have been discharged with a reasonable degree of independence from the Executive branch, as L.K. Advani noted in his letter to then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, ‘keeping these important decisions as the exclusive preserve of the ruling party renders the selection process vulnerable to manipulation and partisanship’, especially when it is critical that these posts are filled by persons with ‘competence, integrity, and an impeccable record of service’.22 This consideration also applies to such critical bodies as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and a number of regulatory and other bodies that inter alia act as institutions of restraint.
  While Advani was only advocating the inclusion of the leader of the Opposition in the selection process, the interests of the political class tend to coincide in choosing someone who is amenable to influence and pressure from the government in power. It is important to broaden the appointments committee for all key appointments to include representatives from civil society and eminent persons knowledgeable in the area to ensure transparency and due process.
V. Citizens and the State: The Direct Link
While India’s formal institutions have mostly experienced a slow process of decay, India has experienced a social revolution in its informal institutions. This is owed to two parallel and reinforcing phenomena. First, compensating for state failure, citizens have found ways to enhance their voice. Civil society has grown exponentially and become a powerful tool in exposing government to public scrutiny. Registered NGOs now number over 3 million. That they are beginning to make a thin-skinned political class uncomfortable is reflected in both the UPA and NDA efforts to clip their wings. Citizens’ voice is also amplified by the rapid growth of the media and, particularly, television viewership, which has risen from 1.2 million TV homes in 1992 to 168 million in 2014, and from one state-owned TV channel to 800 channels, of which some 400 are 24x7 news channels in fifteen languages.23 Numerous daily TV debates expose government policies to close scrutiny and educate citizens on issues.
  Second, the telecommunication revolution is transforming connectivity between citizens and creating an instrument that amplifies citizens’ voice and transmits it instantly across the country. Starting from almost scratch at the turn of the century, India now has close to 700 million unique users of mobile connections and 375 million users of the Internet (see Table 3). This is still a nascent industry. Penetration rates are still low but will soon catch up with countries such as China and Indonesia. Internet connectivity is becoming the norm, marking a fundamental transformation in the way people communicate and access information. Current usage is confined to the upper and middle classes but is spreading rapidly, especially among the young.

The impact on governance of this social-cum-communication revolution is being felt in a variety of ways. The most revolutionary change has been the 2005 Right to Information Act, which has empowered citizens to access information from government agencies pertaining to personal issues, grievances and entitlements. NGOs are also facilitating access of the poor and the illiterate to such information. Civil society organizations and the media have used the law to expose corruption, seek information about government policies and expose misuse of government resources. Some 5 million requests for information are filed each year.24 There has also been a proliferation of NGOs that monitor different aspects of governance from elections and political parties to the judiciary and corruption. The communication revolution has enabled a sharing of this information, resulting in an electorate that is better informed. Political parties are slowly awakening to this information revolution, attempting to use social media for their own ends. The growth of social media and the Internet is also forcing debates on issues such as the right to privacy, freedom of speech and censorship, copyright laws and the creative commons. Internet technology is therefore becoming both an area and an instrument of governance.
VI. The Governance–Growth Paradox
The rapid economic growth experienced in the last twenty-five years raises the question as to how this was possible with the steady deterioration in governance and institutions. Various explanations have been offered. Arvind Subramanian, currently chief economic adviser in the Ministry of Finance suggests, first, that prior to the 1980s, India was underachieving relative to the quality of its institutions. Thus, the relatively modest reforms introduced in the 1980s ‘allowed it to get a big bang’. Second, the decline of the Congress party and the consequent shift in power to the states allowed state governments to ‘differentiate themselves, not least in their ability to attract private investment’, especially following the gradual dismantling of industrial licensing.25 Growth accelerated in the states that were able to do so.
  Devesh Kapur argues that despite the declining quality of India’s institutions and political instability, India’s ‘polymorphic institutions’ have provided an ‘institutional safety net that has limited the downside’.26 As institutions get weakened, space opens up ‘for both new institutions as well as other erstwhile moribund institutions’ and the ‘simultaneous cycle of decay and rejuvenation gives the system a certain resilience’.27 He cites the example of the Prime Minister’s Office which, over time, has emerged as a major institution for coordination. He also notes how the office of the President, the Election Commission and the judiciary—all institutions of restraint under the Indian Constitution—have sought to fill the void left by a weak Executive and Parliament. It could also be argued that markets have taken over many of the functions of the state in the post-liberalization period and that both the private sector and civil society have stepped in to fill the void left by failing service delivery by the state.
  Economic growth occurs despite poor governance both in India and in most of the other fast-growing developing economies. But what is the quality of that growth? Typically, it is accompanied by high regional, income and asset inequality. The inequality is fed by both the policies that crony capitalists ‘buy’ with their financial contributions to political parties, by the rents that accrue from such purchases, and by the capture of the state as when the private sector borrows money for infrastructure provision from state-owned banks, which are then left with high non-performing assets. The growth also comes in the form of high energy-consuming urban construction and a rapid growth in private vehicle ownership as distinct from public transport, all contributing to a serious deterioration in the environment, with high social and private costs.
  Economic growth and rising incomes should have resulted in better governance. As incomes rise, citizens demand better services and better institutions. However, a weak response to these demands from public institutions has resulted in the private sector stepping in to meet the demand inter alia through electricity generators providing insurance against power breakdowns from state utilities, security companies protecting citizens’ homes, and private provision of health and education. Even the poor, frustrated by absentee teachers and poor health services, are seeking out largely unregulated private providers that they can ill afford. This exercise of Hirschman’s ‘exit’ option has the unintended consequence of further reducing pressure on public institutions to improve their performance.28
  However, a research paper by Nicholas Charron that examines corruption in twenty Indian states, based on a 2005 Transparency International survey, finds that states with higher per capita incomes, higher literacy and lower dependence on revenue transfers from the central government tend also to be less corrupt. The findings support the ‘incontrovertible’ long-run association between good governance and higher incomes. It also reinforces the view that the information and communication revolution described above is increasing awareness of poor service delivery and the large inequities in society. In a democracy like India’s, this is bound to force change on a reluctant political class.
  Discussions about the governance-growth paradox tend to view governance as a means to development and higher income. But for the average citizen, and particularly for the poor, good governance is an end in itself, as important as rising incomes. It is a sad reality that after seventy years of independence, the poor and the downtrodden experience some form of humiliation each day, however minor, from their leaders who expect them to touch their feet, from bureaucrats who exceed their authority, and from a police force that sees its principal role as protecting ruling elites from the masses and interprets the rule of law as not equality for all before the law but the enforcement of law and order. For them, good governance is about restoring their self-respect and protecting their basic human rights.
VII. Priorities for Reform
There is a wide consensus in India about the importance of reforming governance. This is reflected in the election manifestos of political parties, newspaper editorials and in the views of the numerous pundits on the evening talk shows. Institutional reforms are also needed to sustain growth. There is no shortage of advocated solutions to this crisis of governance. Numerous reports from national commissions, committees, working groups and think tanks have examined the issues that need to be addressed. Reforms will not be difficult to design, for much of the work has been done in analysing the issues and discussing options. However, there is a broad consensus outside the political class that reforms need to be designed to protect what are unelected bodies, such as the judiciary, the administrative services and the police, from political interference. This is a recipe for inaction on governance issues. It is also unhealthy in a democracy to establish systems in which the people’s representatives are unable to control the organizations they need, to deliver services to citizens who voted for them. The only way that reforms are likely to happen is for civil society to engage the political class in a dialogue on governance reforms.
  Three areas deserve the highest priority:
  The first and the most difficult is political party reform. The agenda here is clear: inner-party democracy, transparency in the funding of elections, including the option of state funding, publication of the audited financial accounts of parties, and clear rules that eliminate criminal elements from contesting elections. Civil society needs to educate citizens on this agenda and support political parties that favour such reforms. This will be easier if the corporate sector, which primarily funds political parties, takes a more enlightened view of its long-term self-interest and refuses to support parties that are not willing to accept reforms. Political party reform will ease the task of other governance reforms and, in the longer run, result in a healthier political market in which new leaders emerge, who build their public support by delivering outcomes and who see governance reforms as facilitating this process rather than as a threat.
  The second priority is to reform the process by which India’s guardians of accountability (constitutional and statutory authorities and key regulatory institutions, including the RBI) are chosen so as to ensure that persons of integrity and exceptional quality occupy these offices. Sri Lanka has shown the way through its Nineteenth Amendment to its Constitution. A similar approach adjusted to our circumstances could be developed. The inclusion of eminent outsiders in selection panels would ensure that the process is transparent.
  The third priority is to reform the institutions responsible for the rule of law: the judiciary and the police. In both cases, the institutions need modernization and world-class management, and they need additional resources to perform their critical functions. India spends far too little as a share of its national income on rule of law institutions, and it is paying a heavy price for it.
  The civil service is at the heart of India’s governance and ignoring it could slow down any reform process. While wholesale reform is needed, and should be initiated, it will necessarily take a long time. However, critical initiatives identified in the Second Administrative Reform Commission report and discussed above need not wait and could shift the incentives officers face, strengthen domain expertise and restrain frequent transfers.
  While establishing priorities is important, governance systems are interdependent and closely interlinked. A failure in one area could prevent progress in another. The gross understaffing at senior level in all institutions, and at all levels in the case of the police, accompanied by high vacancy rates in relation to sanctioned posts, is part of a larger pattern of under-investment in institutions, which urgently needs to be addressed.

Changing Colours of Government–Business Relations
Tarun Das
Business and government worked as one team on domestic and foreign-policy issues. This period represented a new phenomenon in government–business relations and much credit has to go to the officials who were ‘secure’, were comfortable interacting with business without, in any way, being compromised.
Backdrop
Before 1947, Indian business was aligned with the Indian political leadership. The ‘Bombay Plan’ framed by J.R.D. Tata, G.D. Birla and other business leaders outlined an economic development strategy for post-Independence India, but, after 1947, the distance between the public and private sectors only grew.
  This was reflected in the government’s Industrial Licensing Policy, the Industries Development and Regulations Act 1956, the Monopolies Act, the Monopolies and Trade Practices Commission and a host of other legislative and policy measures to limit the freedom of the private sector to grow. Additionally, a new term was introduced: the ‘public sector’, to occupy the commanding heights of the economy. Essentially, this constituted a reflection of mistrust of business, with the government imposing a micromanagement economic policy regime.
  This process continued till the 1980s, resulting in distance, differences and even confrontation between the government and the business sector. However, some of the larger business groups thrived within this system of controls by exercising their own influence and pre-empting capacities. Particularly odious were the restrictions on small businesses to grow. Artificial limits were placed on small entrepreneurs to access finance and other facilities. Entrepreneurship was not in favour!
  As a result, the colour of government–business relations was a depressing black.
Early Changes
The first real sign of change in the relationship between the government and business came in 1983, when Rajiv Gandhi (then general secretary of the Congress), called the Association of Indian Engineering Industry (AIEI), the predecessor of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), to brief him and other political leaders and senior officials in a closed-door, several-hour-long session on ‘industrial development’ issues. This went far beyond formal protocol meetings.
  He continued this process of informal consultations and briefings, which included ministers and senior officials. This was very different from the previous format of written representations by business; usually no response from the government; and meetings and calls on ministers and officials, which were largely protocol and infructuous. It was a frustrating time characterized by little or no dialogue. The exception: between T.A. Pai, industry minister for a few years, and Mantosh Sondhi (secretary, heavy industry and, later, secretary, steel). Both engaged, listened and acted to support a new model of government–industry dialogue in their area of responsibility. They did not have a hostile or negative attitude towards business. Quite the contrary.
  Rajiv Gandhi took the engagement to another level when he became prime minister. On 22 March 1985, he spent time with AIEI, focusing only on export strategy. In May 1985, he overruled the objections of the ‘system’ to take a private-sector delegation of eighteen CEOs from AIEI to Moscow on his first state visit. In a meeting in Moscow during that visit, he said that private-sector entrepreneurs would change the future shape of India. This was long before Indian business had any such aspirations.
The Glory Years
The changes in the relationship during Rajiv Gandhi’s prime ministership (1985–89) were carried forward and institutionalized during the 1991–96 period when P.V. Narasimha Rao was prime minister, Manmohan Singh was finance minister and A.N. Verma was principal secretary to the prime minister. Rakesh Mohan (economic adviser, Ministry of Industry), Jayanta Roy (economic adviser, Ministry of Commerce), Montek Ahluwalia (finance secretary), N.K. Singh (revenue secretary) and Naresh Chandra (then Cabinet secretary) also played a key role, making a significant difference.
  The business sector and the government worked as one team on domestic- and foreign-policy issues with day-to-day leadership being provided by Verma. There was dialogue, engagement, consultation, sharing of views, travelling with the prime minister abroad—Davos, Vietnam, Singapore, etc. Much of this new teamwork was quietly done, below the radar and outside media attention. It was a new phenomenon and not a one-off effort. On the business side, some of the key players were Ratan Tata, Rahul Bajaj, Dhruv Sawhney, Jamshed Irani, Jamshyd Godrej and Subodh Bhargava.
  This period represented a new phenomenon in government–business relations, and much credit has to go to the officials who were comfortable interacting with business without, in any way, being compromised. A clear reason for this sense of security among these officials was that the long-term tenures they had served in the government had proved their capability and integrity. Business, too, worked seamlessly with them irrespective of whether they were principal secretaries, secretaries or joint secretaries.
  The ‘colour’ of the relationship between the government and the business sector was transformed from the earlier situation of distance to closeness, from ‘black’ to a cheerful ‘blue’, from mistrust to trust. In 1993 and 1994, the teamwork between the government and industry was at its best. The following were the highlights during the two years:
1. The eighteen-member CEO’s mission to Singapore by CII, which spent four and a half hours with Singaporean Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong;
2. The detailed feedback to the Indian Prime Minister’s Office (PMO);
3. The visit of the Indian prime minister to Singapore in 1994, accompanied by a CII team;
4. The lecture by the Indian prime minister in Singapore on India’s Look East policy; and
5. The opening of CII’s Singapore office during the Indian prime minister’s visit. The entire exercise was quietly coordinated by the PMO, the Ministry of External Affairs and the CII working in close harmony. India came out looking very good.
The relationship change corresponded with major policy changes by the government, such as abolishing industrial and import licensing, the Monopolies Act and the Monopolies Commission. Liberalization and deregulation was the order of the day, driven by Manmohan Singh, A.N. Verma and his team, with the prime minister lending political cover. GDP growth rapidly jumped to 7 per cent for the last three years of the 1991–96 period. There was premature euphoria in the air.
  In the post-1991 period, there were amazing stories of public–private partnerships, i.e., the government and industry working together, heralding a new phase of government–business relationship. One particular example continues to this day.
Davos: Bridge to the World
The CII has had a strong collaboration with the World Economic Forum (WEF), Geneva, since 1984, which led to a business–government joint effort to use the annual Davos Symposium in Switzerland, organized by WEF, to project India. Davos is the ski resort in Switzerland where WEF brings together the world’s leaders—from business, politics, media, the arts—and the agenda is structured with a bias for discussion of topics key to the global economy and international relations (to put it briefly), created and built under the leadership of professor Klaus Schwab, founder president, WEF, an outstanding world leader himself. CII-promoted Indian corporates joined the forum as members; CII organized an India reception each year, which increased in international popularity year after year. Indian CEOs hosted a separate reception. Indian speakers were included on panels. Indian artists, such as Amjad Ali Khan, performed. Indian prime ministers delivered keynote speeches. Indian ministers and officials participated and presented the Indian perspective. This extended to the states. The first state to become a member of WEF was Andhra Pradesh, and Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu prioritized the use of Davos to reach out for investment in the state.
  Davos was used as a bridge to the world, with the Indian government, state governments and the business sector, working in concert. This partnership still continues and the investment of time, energy and finance to use Davos for India’s national interest has been well served, year after year. It is an ideal example of government and business working in harness.
  In addition, the relationship with WEF led to Indian participation in their events and meetings around the world, giving Indian government and business a platform for outreach, be it in China, Africa, Latin America or Asia. At the same time, the CII gave WEF a special platform in India with the central and state governments.
Ministry of External Affairs
Davos was a classic example of partnership involving the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, the PMO and the CII. However, there were also outstanding examples of partnership between the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) and the CII.
  In late 1980, nine years after the creation of Bangladesh, India was given a green signal to organize a major Indian event in Dhaka to be executed by March 1981—a very tight deadline. AIEI (CII’s predecessor body) was tasked to deliver a trade fair, conferences, cultural programmes, etc. at very short notice, just three months. It had to be done and it was done, with trucks crossing rivers, carrying exhibits. The exhibition and related events were so popular that the event was extended, since people from all over Bangladesh were coming to visit. The Indian High Commission in Dhaka led by ambassadors Muchkund Dubey and Kuldip Sahdev were indispensable to the project’s success; Mrs Padma Sahdev fed the AIEI staff, day after day. India–Bangladesh relations took a turn for the better.
  Another case was Mauritius. Shyam Saran was high commissioner and CII organized a ‘Made in India’ show—exhibition, fashion show (Indian fabrics), cultural programmes, etc. The prime minister of Mauritius and the people of the country were wooed by India successfully. Such was the response that the show was repeated during Shyam Saran’s tenure. The MEA and the CII worked hand-in-hand to implement these high-profile events. A third case was in Singapore, where the MEA, the Indian High Commission and the CII came together to stage a similar set of programmes to project India effectively.
  There are many other examples of successful cooperation between the MEA and the CII and the Indian mission. All of these were enormously appreciated and made a difference to bilateral relations.
The United Front Days
Post-elections, in 1996–98, with the United Front coalition government, the relationship continued, but with little to show in terms of new policy initiatives except Finance Minister P. Chidambaram’s ‘Dream Budget’ reducing the tax rates. This period also saw the South East Asian financial crisis, lower growth and new pains in the economy and the industries. Businesses sought a slower pace for liberalization and increased protection, a scenario very different from the 1991–96 period. Government–business relations took a somewhat different turn. Dialogue continued but differences arose on the reforms.
The Vajpayee Years
When NDA-I came to power in Delhi in the late 1990s, with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani at the helm, there was a fresh look at Indian business and business organizations, their role, their political affinities (if any), their capability and competence.
  A number of questions seemed to challenge the government:
1. Was partnership and collaboration possible in the true and real sense?
2. Was business, which had worked closely with previous governments of other political parties, politicized and politically aligned?
3. Were business organizations trustworthy and dependable?
4. Was business only self-seeking or was it able to look at national interest and work for it?
These were natural, important questions and the process of building confidence and trust was based on actions, not words. The government was favourably disposed to the private sector, but it took a steady process of work to build a climate and environment of working together. What helped enormously was that the PMO had a very senior position of secretary (economic), occupied by N.K. Singh, fully focused on the economy, economic policies, economic growth and interaction with business. This was an ideal structure to forge a renewed government–business partnership, especially since N.K. Singh himself was deeply knowledgeable about economic affairs and was committed to working with business. It was a perfect system at the apex of the government.
  The prime minister’s visits to New York and elsewhere were specific occasions when the responsibility for organization and leadership was entrusted to business entities. So also, when the finance minister of India made overseas visits, conferences and outreach events were organized to showcase India. These were important occasions for outreach to investors in different countries, and the planning and execution were jointly done by the government and business working in close concert. Every visit was used to put together events to promote investment in India. The 1998 nuclear tests by India had led to an adverse reaction and sanctions by the West. The environment had altered. The joint outreach, in this backdrop, became very important, and it worked for India.
  The World Trade Organization annual conference in Cancun was another example of Commerce Minister Arun Jaitley leading a delegation of government and business. Consultations with business representatives to frame India’s negotiating strategy on a day-to-day basis in Cancun was very special; the teamwork under Jaitley’s leadership exceeded past precedents—business engaged with international counterparts on behalf of India; business addressed the media putting forward the Indian perspective, etc. This was a great example of mutual trust and partnership. The commerce minister even included business in his daily morning strategy meetings with senior officials. This was ‘India Inc.’ at work.
  Business did not interact only with the PMO, finance, external affairs, commerce and industry ministries. Science and technology, education, health, steel, chemicals, food and agriculture were some of the other ministries that worked closely with business, focusing on consultations related to development, troubleshooting and growth. Business also interacted with the Planning Commission, which worked on the Five-Year Plans.
Being Non-partisan
Business also learnt how important it was to be non-partisan although the Congress had governed at the Centre in New Delhi during 1947–77, 1980–89 and 1991–96. Business learnt about the sensitivities of political parties and how to engage without becoming politically aligned. This was essential learning and practice to maintain continuity of cooperation with successive governments and their leaders.
  A specific example of this was the 1991 suggestion by Manmohan Singh to CII to engage members of Parliament (MP) of different political parties and brief them on economic issues. This became a regular activity with MPs of different states. In August 1991, at the first-ever structured dialogue with West Bengal MPs, essentially from the communist parties, the CII was told by them that it was selling out the country by promoting and supporting liberalization. Countering this with data was critical, and it was done.
  Nonetheless, the process of dialogue with MPs continued quietly and, over the years, there was positive cross-party support to economic reforms. It was hard work. It was sustained with meetings being held during Parliament sessions, the usual venue being the State Bhavan (Guest House), which was convenient for the MPs. Several meetings were held using the state language, since many MPs were not familiar with English.
  It was a huge challenge that Manmohan Singh, then finance minister, had posed. The enormity of it dawned on business leaders with the passage of time, but this initiative was continuously deepened. It still carries on, twenty-five years after it began.
  Ironically, the West Bengal chief minister of the Communist Party (Marxist), some years after 1991, nominated the chief executive of a business organization—CII—to head a major joint-sector company, Haldia Petrochemicals, reflecting the trust and confidence of the communists!
2004–14: Ups and Downs
The period of Manmohan Singh’s prime ministership from 2004 to 2014 witnessed many formal meetings but perhaps not the same quality and depth of government–business informal consultations and teamwork as during Prime Minister Vajpayee’s tenure. These formal meetings were not agenda-based and comprised a round of views expressed by the business leaders present. There were too many speeches and too many complaints, but not enough new ideas and little or no follow-up action. Mutual expectations were not fulfilled, leading to increasing public articulation of the business sector’s disappointment with the government, especially post-2009. The prime minister’s Advisory Council on Trade and Industry continued to meet but people appeared to be talking at each other, rather than with each other. No question, the earlier teamwork of 1991–96 and 1998–2004 had broken down, though formal contact and meetings were held.
  One significant occasion was when Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, on 24 May 2007, outlined a ten-point charter of ‘Business Responsibility’ at the CII Annual Conference; he covered labour relations, corporate social responsibility, affirmative action, remuneration for top management, skills development, anti-competition behaviour, the environment, innovation, corruption and socially responsible advertising.
  This was a huge initiative by the prime minister to reach out to business to integrate itself with national development goals and this ten-point charter still holds good. The media, sadly, reacted adversely instead of welcoming his ideas. Business, too, responded less than enthusiastically, thus losing a great opportunity to align with national interest and take new leadership in the country’s growth process. This adverse to lukewarm reaction led the government to step back from deepening its dialogue with business. The prime minister certainly withdrew.
Track II Dialogue
Again, the only significant ‘success stories’ were outside media attention, in the successful efforts to forge defence and nuclear cooperation between India and the US and the new beginnings with Japan. The Track II bilateral strategic dialogues played a quiet part, the focus and ambit of these dialogues being on foreign policy areas, not domestic policy. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh supported this process and, in fact, asked that a dialogue with Japan be initiated.
  This process of international engagement to deepen India’s significant bilateral relationships was very much a government–business informal partnership. The US, Japan, China, Singapore, Turkey, Bhutan, etc. were covered in a sustained effort. More such are under consideration, as past results have been positive.
The States and Business
In looking at government–business relationships, the state governments must not be ignored. Over a period of time, states have become increasingly conscious of the need to strengthen the state economy and, in that, the key partnership agendas are: the role of business to fuel investment, to give access to corporates outside India and the state, to project the state, etc.
  One constant aspect was cooperation to organize state-level investment promotion conferences. Another was to organize trade fairs or exhibitions that focus on state resources and help in projecting these.
  A classic example of state–business partnership was set in motion in the late 1990s between the Andhra Pradesh government with Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu and the CII. The two came together to set up a joint task force with the chief minister as chairman and the CII president as co-chair. The task force had the industry minister of the state, chief secretary, industry secretary and other senior officials in addition to select CEOs from CII’s membership.
  This task force worked like a board of directors, discussing every aspect of the state’s economic development and strategy. Among other achievements, Andhra Pradesh was the first state to become a member of the WEF, Geneva, and the chief minister participated in the Davos Symposium each year, meeting CEOs of the world individually, inviting them to invest in the state and, literally, working from 7 a.m. to midnight every single day. In all of this, the CII provided constant support.
  This first-ever joint task force was succeeded by a number of other states following similar models. It was a unique partnership strategy and structure. The model was later also extended to specific country-focused initiatives with the US, Japan and Singapore as joint endeavours.
  There are varying models of such partnership. At one extreme is a model where control is exercised by the government with execution by business. Alternatively, there may be joint consultation and implementation by business, which is given more trust and space. A welcome way is when the chief minister and his/her senior officials actually brainstorm on strategy and plans with business and, then, by and large entrust the work going forward to the business organization. Regular review meetings are, of course, a must.
  States have come a long way in projecting themselves as investment centres and, across India, there is interstate competition. All to the good.
Now, the Present
The 2014–16 period under Prime Minister Narendra Modi has seen a somewhat different type of relationship emerging between the government and business. Clearly, there appears to be far greater centralization of decision-making with the tendency to seek the prime minister’s view and directions much more than before. This is a new phenomenon.
  CEOs of MNCs seem to have been able to meet the prime minister but not so Indian CEOs. This strategy was unclear to Indian business, which had hoped for a close ‘connect’ and dialogue with the prime minister. Institutions of industry met the prime minister in 2015, according to media reports. These seem to have been one-off meetings. Not a regular dialogue process. Business clearly seeks to have a regular dialogue since the prime minister, personally, is very focused on economy.
  What is not clear is whether business brings new data and ideas to such a dialogue, and whether business uses such valuable opportunities to ‘whine’ about problems and constraints rather than talk of future strategy. Business needs to add value, which means data, analysis and ideas. These would enhance their position in connecting to the government, which, in turn, would respect such value addition. Research backup for business to make a difference is critical.
  The expectation of the prime minister from such a dialogue is also unclear. Is it a ‘listening brief’? Is it a two-way dialogue? Is it to communicate clear messages to business in terms of expectations of the government? Or a mix of all of these?
  Business has supported mega events of the government, relating to ‘Make in India’ and other initiatives. Make in India, Swachh Bharat (Clean India), Smart Cities, Skills Mission are some major missions of the current government, and business is associated with all of these. But the quality and depth of business involvement is unclear. These seem to be essentially government-led. Individual, selected CEOs have travelled with Modi to certain countries where CEO forum meetings have been held. It is known that the prime minister has also made time on some of his overseas visits to interact with the Indian Business Delegation.
  There has been a change in the psychology of business leaders. Many corporates have become giants. They want to interact with the prime minister because they see him as powerful and decisive. Big businesses have big egos, more than ever before. So, the consultation process appears to be essentially with the finance minister who is, of course, very important. Sadly, it is less so with the commerce and industry minister and least of all with the prime minister, though his principal secretary and other PMO officials are engaged with business. In the 1990s, business leaders were comfortable working with even mid-level officials. Currently, the focus seems to be on ministerial-level engagement. One reason could be the frequent transfer of officials.
  Perhaps the government has yet to settle into a ‘trust’-based relationship, a ‘partnership’ with business as distinct from an ‘event’-based engagement where the industry is the organizer and implementer under the direction of the government. Time will tell. However, clearly, murmurs of disappointment have been emerging from business about the lack of deep engagement with the prime minister and some of his ministers. Perhaps expectations of business were excessive in 2014 and, in retrospect, it needs to be remembered that PM Narasimha Rao, PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee and PM Manmohan Singh all interacted with industry and business infrequently. There was no rationale to expect differently from PM Modi.
  At one level, with deregulation and a steadily opening economy, the role of the private sector has increased in the national economy. On the other hand, distance between the government and business remains. It does not appear to be ‘India Inc.’ at work, unfortunately; it needs to be so, based on clearly understood guidelines and boundaries, mutually accepted and followed. Bringing the government and business together in a transparent, non-crony team is the way forward. India has yet to achieve this.
  One of the challenges for business has always been the sensitivity of the government to public (as distinct from private) criticism or difference of opinion. Often, business is ‘pulled up’ for media reports of criticism of government policies and procedures. Sometimes, the ‘cold shoulder’ treatment is meted out by way of ‘non-response’ and avoidance of meetings and contacts. Ministers have been known to cancel, last minute, engagements and meetings with business to show displeasure. At other times, calls are received by business to bring out advertisements or press statements supporting the government. These are done but with reluctance and resentment.
  In the past, the government has had ministers and officials who would take swipes at business at public events because these made media headlines. It lead to business withdrawing from dialogue, drawing into a shell and quietly resenting the criticism.
  Business too has a constituency that pushes for publicly expressed critical statements. This has always been a ‘no-win’ game. It actually sets the government–business relationship back in time and then it takes time to rebuild and renew dialogue and trust.
  All of this is immature, unnecessary and unwise. Government and business need each other to strengthen the national economy and the economic growth process in the country. They are two sides of the same coin. Both need each other. To remember this fact of life and stick to dialogue, irrespective of media pressure and the short-term attractiveness of media headlines, is the real need.
  The best strategy, learnt over many years of experience of dealing with different governments, is to engage in quiet dialogue. Away from media attention—private, informal, frank, but not offensive. This ensures that solutions are achieved, egos are not bruised and confrontation is avoided. Public positions are not adopted. Time and again, quiet dialogue has led to a consensus being worked out to mutual satisfaction. What is important is to set up a system and structure, to not be ad hoc.
  Unfortunately, private, quiet dialogue is often seen, by those not in the room, as mysterious and sinister, implying that deals are being done without taking into account all views. To make dialogue work, it has to include a group of persons from both sides. It cannot be a one-to-one exercise.
  This is particularly so because the societal image of business is generally unfavourable and negative. Barring rare exceptions, business is perceived as selfish and self-centred, driven by profit and material gains, short-term in targets, adding to inequality by a huge disparity in emoluments between CEOs and employees, avoiding taxes, not treating labour right, not being generous in contributing through finance and effort to deal with crucial national challenges such as education, healthcare, skills development, sports, and so on. As a result, these negative images impact the government’s willingness to engage deeply and fully. Often, the government is necessarily selective in collaborative efforts based on the level of trust.
  At the same time, there is growing recognition in the government that it needs this partnership. It is for business leadership to earn trust on a sustained basis through self-regulation and self-discipline, through the right actions, not just words. This is a huge challenge for business and its leadership—to introspect and review its own actions and policies and turn a new leaf.
  If business is able to respond positively to Manmohan Singh’s ten-point charter, which is not difficult, then a new alignment will emerge—of business, government and society in step, together.
  In society, in the economy, business is the most capable resource in terms of education, knowledge, leadership, management skills, wealth, standards of living, etc. Business needs to put the nation and society first and itself last. This will, then, help to build trust in business and the ‘colours’ of government–business relations will take on the happy, cheerful colours of the ‘rainbow’. Unfortunately, as of now, there is still some distance to cover to reach that stage.

Union–State Relations and Reforms1
Y. Venugopal Reddy
The practice of fiscal federalism in India has been commendable over a long-term perspective in view of the severe challenges posed since independence. Greater role of states in the pursuit of decentralized development should not undermine the role the Union government has to play in maintaining macroeconomic stability.
The paper is an analytical account of Union–state relations, with a main focus on the reforms since 1991. Macro-fiscal stabilization in a multilevel fiscal system is not easy, especially when the subnational deficit is high. Deficit management challenges in the multilevel fiscal system of India have given shape to the Union–state fiscal relations post 1991 in a major way. The paper postulates that the practice of fiscal federalism in India has been commendable over a long-term perspective in view of the severe challenges posed since Independence. Due to the severe macro-fiscal imbalances that existed then, an important element of the reforms undertaken in 1991 has been a correction of fiscal imbalances of both the Union government and state governments. A study of the path of fiscal adjustment since then shows that reduction in fiscal imbalances has almost continuously fallen short of goals set regarding the central government, and an asymmetric fiscal-adjustment burden has fallen on the states. In particular, correction of imbalances at the state level was impressive in the second half of the period of reform, but the fiscal space vacated by them was often occupied by the Union. The contrast in their performances is striking with regard to revenue deficit, with the Union failing to eliminate it in each of the years of reform.
  The paper explains that the era of rule-based fiscal control initiated in the second half of the reform period provides explanations for this asymmetry. The fiscal rules, imposed by the Union on itself, were changed frequently to accommodate the pressures. However, the states had less headroom to be flexible due to the role of the Union in ensuring fiscal discipline by the states through a well-defined structure of incentive-compatible deficit reduction proposed by the Twelfth and Thirteenth Finance Commissions. In other words, the Union used the instrumentality of the Finance Commissions to bring about changes in the transfer system and promote observance of fiscal rules among the states.
  The other important aspect of reform is changes in the nature of intergovernmental fiscal relations outside the ambit of the Finance Commission post-1991. Due to the proliferation of big-ticket centrally sponsored schemes (CSS), the intergovernmental transfers outside the purview of Finance Commissions, i.e., under the Plan mechanism, increased to an unprecedented extent since reforms commenced. This in turn resulted in a sharp decline in the share of central assistance to state plans, which was formula-based, resulting in substantial reduction in fiscal autonomy at the state level. Although reforms over the years improved the revenues of the general government as a share of GDP, relative shares of the Union and the states remained unchanged. Moreover, due to the proliferation of conditional transfers through CSS, the fiscal policy space available to the states shrank during the reform period. The changes in the transfer system, the recommendations by the Fourteenth Finance Commission, and the replacement of Planning Commission with NITI Aayog need to be seen in this context.
  Reforms were not confined to just the transfer system in taxation—neither at the central nor at the state level. Significant tax reforms were undertaken both by the Union and the states, especially with regard to the levy of service tax by the Union and value added tax (VAT) by the states. The elimination of on-lending to states by the central government is also significant. Reforms in the power sector represent a complex arrangement between Union and state governments, involving central– as well as state–public enterprises. They encompass conditionality and, hence, quasi-fiscal operations of large magnitudes with significant fiscal impact.
  The paper invites attention to some recent developments that indicate a new trend in Union–state relations. It suggests that for the first time since 2015, India is at a crucial moment of redefining these relations. The paper concludes with the detailing of the unfinished agenda for rebalancing of Union–state relations after launching NITI Aayog, the new dynamic that is in the offing in the form of the Goods and Services Tax Council, which will impact both vertical and horizontal balances. The paper urges a new agenda for reform, which combines decentralization with deregulation.
Record of Fiscal Federalism
The record of the practice of fiscal federalism in India must be viewed in constitutional and political contexts, in terms of economic management, including the external sector, while considering intergovernmental fiscal arrangements.
  First, India had to simultaneously design the units that would constitute the new federation while setting in motion the processes to form the ‘Union’. That unprecedented task has been performed well. It is remarkable that national integration in India has been facilitated by the Union, which recognized and accepted diversity as it emerged and asserted from time to time. This is reflected in the process of reorganization of the states since 1956, if not 1953, when Andhra Pradesh was formed on a linguistic basis.
  Second, with regard to the political context, India can boast of peaceful change of political regimes in a regular and systematic manner. Credit for that goes as much to the states as to the Union. All elections, to Parliament as well as state legislature, are conducted wholly by the bureaucracy belonging to different states under the aegis of the Central Election Commission. The Union government has no administrative machinery of its own to conduct such operations, and the Election Commission operates through state governments.
  Third, in terms of economic management, many, if not all, states have improved their capabilities to plan, allocate resources, and implement policies and programmes. The gap between expertise at Union level and state level in many cases has narrowed in recent years for several reasons, especially technological development and globalization. In fact, many states legitimately claim that almost all flagship schemes of the Union government in recent years were, in fact, initiated at the state level. They were initially viewed with disfavour by the Union government. But in recent years, the debate has not been between the Mahalanobis Brahmananda models, but between the Tamil Nadu, Bihar and Gujarat models.
  Fourth, as per the Constitution, the borrowing programme of a state must be approved by the Union as long as it owes debt to the Union. This enables exercise of restraint on borrowings by states. The Union has exercised its powers responsibly, despite some complaints. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is the debt manager for both the Union and the states. The involvement of RBI provides a degree of comfort to the financial markets.
  Fifth, constitutional provisions prohibit external borrowings by states. This ensures that problems in the external sector do not arise on account of the states’ incurring external liabilities beyond sustainable levels. Many other developing countries have faced problems on this account.
  Sixth, in terms of arrangements for fiscal transfers to subnational governments, the basic structure of fiscal federalism was drawn from the Government of India Act, 1935. It will be appropriate to compare the Indian experience with other federations among emerging economies, such as South Africa, China, Brazil and Indonesia. The arrangements for transfer in most of these countries provide a far greater discretion to the federal government than in India. The primary mode of transfers in these countries is grants from the higher to lower levels of government, and such transfers are often discretionary. These countries do not have a constitutional provision for sharing of national-level taxes, unlike in the case of India and Pakistan. In India, the arrangements for transfers to local bodies have undergone changes in recent years, but arrangements for Union–state transfers remain the same.
  In our Constitution, the Finance Commission was devised as a mechanism for providing predictability in the fiscal federal relations for five years. Generally, flexibility to review and revise the relations was available only every five years. The Planning Commission was an innovation of the Union government. It not only had expertise but its functioning also allowed for flexibility to accommodate fiscal needs arising out of sociopolitical developments from time to time. This has since been replaced by NITI Aayog, effective from 1 January 2015. This measure, along with the acceptance of recommendations of the Fourteenth Finance Commission, represents a new setting for fiscal federalism. Since 1991, Union–state fiscal relations were incidental to reforms at the national level, while the new setting since 2005 represents reforms in fiscal federalism.
The Path of Fiscal Adjustment
Large fiscal imbalances resulted in a major macroeconomic crisis in 1991, which warranted structural adjustment to focus initially on fiscal deficit reduction of the central government. A major tax reform was also initiated to simplify the tax system and to reduce progressively both the direct and indirect tax rates at the Union level. The move towards convergence of excise duty structure and sharp reduction in customs duty resulted in significant reduction in tax to GDP ratio of the Union government. As macroeconomic stabilization required reduction in fiscal deficit, the entire burden of fiscal adjustment fell on the expenditure side of the budget resulting in decline in capital expenditure to GDP ratio sharply at the Union level. During this period, no major initiative was undertaken at the state level to reduce the fiscal deficit. In fact, managing burgeoning fiscal deficits at the state level became a major challenge. Thus, the combined deficit remained high despite reduction in fiscal deficit at the Union level. During this period, some states signed memoranda of understanding with the Ministry of Finance of the Government of India (GoI) with a commitment to improve their fiscal positions through sectoral reform, especially in the power sector. But there was no broad-based fiscal reform at the state level during this period. The fiscal situation of the states further deteriorated due to the implementation of the award of the Fifth Pay Commission during the second half of 1990s. During this period, multilateral lending institutions such as Asian Development Bank and World Bank, through structural adjustment loans to the states, introduced fiscal reforms in some states.
  The situation started changing from 2000–01. There was a consistent decline in the level of deficits at both levels of government up to 2007–08. The North Atlantic financial crisis (NAFC) and consequent fiscal expansion increased the level of fiscal deficits, particularly at the central level, after 2007–08.2
  Gross fiscal deficit (GFD) of the Union as a percentage of GDP increased from 2.5 per cent in 2007–08 to 6 per cent in 2008–09 and 6.5 per cent in 2009–10. Correspondingly, revenue deficit of the Union increased from 1.1 to 4.5 per cent and 5.2 per cent in the same period. The fiscal stimulus was almost entirely on revenue account. The fiscal deficit of the Union continued to be above 4 per cent till 2014–15, and has remained close to 4 per cent since then. GFD of the states, however, remained in the range of 1.5 per cent to 2.9 per cent from 2007–08 till 2014–15. In 2015–16, it is estimated to be 3.3 per cent; revenue account was in marginal surplus or deficit during the period. These differences in the path of reforms in fiscal management at central and state levels can be explained in terms of the manner in which rule-based fiscal control operates asymmetrically between the Union and the states.3
The Era of Rule-based Fiscal Control
The Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBM) of the central government was enacted in 2003–04, while most of the states enacted their fiscal responsibility acts in the fiscal year 2005–06. The era of rule-based fiscal control at the Union has been characterized by a series of measures that diluted the rules themselves. The FRBM Act, 2003, and the rules made thereunder laid down a roadmap for the phased reduction of fiscal deficit to 3 per cent of GDP and elimination of the revenue deficit by 31 March 2008. Barely eight months after enactment of the Act, the Union Budget 2005–06 pressed the pause button on the plea that the implementation of the recommendations of the Twelfth Finance Commission would impose additional financial burden. The pause button was again pressed in 2008–09 following the NAFC and increase in the prices of oil. Following the additional obligation on account of the recommendations of the Sixth Pay Commission, the Thirteenth Finance Commission was mandated by an additional terms of reference (ToR) to suggest a revised roadmap. Accordingly, the Commission recommended shifting the timelines for bringing down the fiscal deficit to 3 per cent of GDP and elimination of revenue deficit to 31 March 2014 and 31 March 2015 respectively. By amending the rules, the central government shifted the date for bringing down fiscal deficit to 3 per cent of GDP by March 2017 and introduced the concept of ‘effective revenue deficit’ and its elimination by March 2015, thus diluting the fiscal rules further. The Fourteenth Finance Commission recommended doing away with the concept of ‘effective revenue deficit’ from 1 April 2015 to bring uniformity in the fiscal rules for the Union and the states; it recommended elimination of revenue deficit by March 2020. It is evident that the fiscal rules have not been effective in assuring fiscal adjustment at the Union. At the state level, however, the fiscal rules have been effective in bringing about a significant improvement in fiscal balance. The improvement in fiscal position was on account of reduction of fiscal deficits as well as revenue deficits as a proportion of GDP. In fact, revenue surplus was generated and the ratio of GFD to GDP fell below the permissible 3 per cent. There was increase in capital expenditure. The improvement in the fiscal position at the state level was not only due to the states’ own efforts in increasing the tax revenue and reducing the revenue expenditure, but also due to increased central devolution as a result of buoyant central taxes.
Changes in the Transfer System
The Planning Commission, an advisory body to the Union government, and Finance Commissions mandated by the Constitution, were the main instrumentalities of fiscal transfers from the Union to the states till 2015. Transfers from the Union to the states, outside of those recommended by the Finance Commission, were based on the advice of the Planning Commission. At the time of the initiation of reforms in 1991, about 40 per cent of transfers were in the form of normal central assistance to state plans. The rest were schemes fully or partly funded by the Union but implemented by the state governments. The amounts of transfer to each state were formula-based; the formula was known as Gadgil–Mukherjee formula. The Annual State Plan itself was subject to the approval of the Planning Commission. As the reforms progressed, the normal central assistance to state plans shrank to about 18 per cent and CSS became dominant. During the reform period, recourse was taken to transfer funds directly to implementing agencies, bypassing state governments (this was discontinued from 2014–15). Central ministries were instrumental, particularly during the second half of the reform period, in diluting the non-discretionary flow of resources to the states and in reducing policy space available to the states.
  Fiscal consolidation was not high on the agenda of the Planning Commission. The Union used the instrumentality of Finance Commissions to bring about fiscal reforms at the state level. However, conditionality-based approach to transfers started with the Eleventh Finance Commission (FC-XI). As per the Additional Term of Reference, the task of the FC-XI was to lay down a path of monitorable fiscal reform programmes for states to reduce their revenue deficit. To ensure that the states follow these reform programmes, a portion of the non-plan revenue deficit grants was linked to the progress in implementing the reform programmes termed as ‘incentives fund’. Although various states questioned the constitutional validity of such ToR, and there was no unanimity within FC-XI, the majority view in FC-XI was in favour of rationalized monitorable fiscal reform. The final report of the FC-XI had ‘recommended that 15 % of the revenue deficit grants meant for 15 States during 2000-05 and a matching contribution by Central Government be credited into an Incentive Fund from which fiscal performance based grants should be made available to all 25 States’.
  The FC-XI did draw up a state-specific reform programme. It suggested that the GoI should set up a monitoring agency comprising, among others, representatives of the Planning Commission, the finance ministry of GoI and representatives of the state governments. This agency was to draw up state-specific reform programmes to reduce their revenue deficits. As far as the yardsticks of monitoring are concerned, the broad indicators as suggested are state-level efforts for greater revenue mobilization and expenditure compression. According to FC-XI, specific expenditure components that required to be compressed were salaries and allowances, interest payments and reduction of subsidies.
  The Twelfth Finance Commission (FC-XII) took its task of contributing to fiscal adjustment at state level in all earnestness. It linked state-level fiscal reforms to conditional transfers in several ways. FC-XII recommended that debt consolidation and relief facilities should be conditional upon the enactment of the fiscal responsibility legislation (FRL) at the state level. All the states (except two) enacted the fiscal responsibility legislation post the FC-XII award.
  The Thirteenth Finance Commission (FC-XIII) also carried forward a similar approach to inducing reforms by suggesting incentive grants for the states that adhered to the FRL. Consequently, all the states enacted FRL.
  The Fourteenth Finance Commission (FC-XIV), recognizing that the Union was preaching but not practising fiscal responsibility, recommended a set of fiscal rules for the Union and the states, in a symmetrical manner within a comprehensive framework. It emphasized the shared responsibility for fiscal consolidation.
  It also recommended that the Union government and the RBI bring out a bi-annual report on the public debt of the Union and state governments on a regular and comparable basis and place it in public domain. This was meant to enable wider dissemination of the manner in which this shared responsibility for a conducive fiscal environment was being discharged by the Union and state governments.
  FC-XIV recognized the challenge in designing a basic incentive-compatible framework for achieving fiscal correction and adherence to a rule-bound fiscal framework for the Union and state governments to hold each other accountable over agreed fiscal targets. It stressed the need for stronger mechanisms for ensuring compliance with fiscal targets and enhancing the quality of fiscal adjustment, particularly for the Union government. Accordingly, it recommended several actions by the Union government. It suggested making an amendment to the FRBM Act to omit the definition of effective revenue deficit from 1 April 2015. It also recommended that the objective of balancing revenues and expenditure on the revenue account enunciated in the FRBM Acts should be pursued.
  It recommended an amendment to the FRBM Act of the Union government, inserting a new section mandating the establishment of an independent fiscal council to undertake ex-ante assessment of the fiscal policy implications of budget proposals and their consistency with fiscal policy and rules. In addition, it urged the Union government to take expeditious action to bring into effect Section 7A of the FRBM Act for the purposes of ex-post assessment. Section 7A requires the CAG to conduct a period review of the compliance of the provisions of the FRBM Act by the Union government.
Select Reforms
Though a beginning was made in 1985–86 with the reduction of the peak income tax rate from 62 to 50 per cent and the rate of wealth tax from 5 to 2 per cent, broad-based reforms in Union taxes were initiated only in 1991, following the recommendations of the Tax Reforms Committee (Chelliah Committee). Under the Constitution, the levy of service tax does not fall either in the Union List or in the State List.4 Because of the growing share of the services sector, the Union government introduced service tax in 1994–95 under the residuary powers vested with it.5 Initially, it was levied on three services, viz. insurance other than life insurance, stock brokerage and telecommunications. Over the years, the service tax has been extended to a number of services. Now, the service tax is being levied on all services except those included in the negative list. Alongside tax reforms undertaken by the Union, there were also tax reforms by the states. A major reform by the states was the introduction of Value Added Tax (VAT) from 1 April 2005. The system of sales taxation prevalent in the states prior to the introduction of VAT was riddled with multiplicity of taxes with both inputs and the output being taxed, resulting in cascading effects. The introduction of VAT brought about an impressive growth in the revenue. The revenue impact was positive since it subsumed a number of taxes, surcharges and additional surcharges, and set-off was given for taxes paid on input and previous purchases.6
  The establishment of the Empowered Group of State Finance Ministers is a remarkable institutional innovation in Centre–state relations. In the late 1990s, the need for an ‘Empowered Committee’ was felt to reform the most complex state-level consumption/sales tax system and to replace it with VAT. The Committee did significant innovations in tax policy and implemented a modern tax system—the VAT—at the state level. Though the Empowered Committee is often identified as an institution responsible for implementation of VAT at the state level, it also needs to be noted that as a prelude to VAT, the Committee implemented the concept of a floor rate for sales tax to stop a competitive ‘race to the bottom’ among the states, to attract private investment. The policy of floor rate acted as a major step towards harmonization of the tax system at the state level. This also stopped unhealthy tax competition to a considerable extent and paved the way for implementation of VAT.
  The functioning of the Committee so far shows that the states in India have cooperated with each other to arrive at a tax structure that is by and large harmonized under VAT. States have complied with the decision taken by the Empowered Committee with regard to the rate structure of taxes, exemption and thresholds, even when it was not legally binding. It has also emerged as an important institution for negotiations with the central government on the issue of compensation of VAT and the Goods and Services Tax (GST) architecture involving the Union and the states.
  A landmark reform introduced by the Union on the recommendation of the FC-XII is the termination of on-lending to the states. The Commission felt that while there might have been some justification for the Union to act as a banker when the market interest rates were higher, there was no such need in the low-interest-rate regime and suggested that the states should approach the market directly and avoid the interest spread charged by the Union. The GoI had accepted this recommendation and dispensed with the practice of on-lending to states.
  The Fourteenth Finance Commission recommended an increase in the share of tax devolution to the states from 32 per cent to 42 per cent. But the increase should be seen in the context of including Plan expenditures in the needs of the states. The transfers outside the Finance Commission became predominantly CSS. In the combined revenue receipts, the share of the states after transfers from the Union remained around 64 per cent between 1990 and 2012. Revenue transfers from the Union varied in the narrow range of 24 to 26 per cent in this period. While the states’ share in combined total expenditure varied between 54 and 56 per cent, the variation in combined revenue expenditure was in the range of 53 to 56 per cent. Thus, there was more or less stability in the relative shares of the Union and the states in the combined revenue and expenditure. The FC-XII observed that some of the CSS relating to subjects that can be better handled by states should be in the fiscal space of states. It also expressed the view that there are schemes that normally need to be in the states’ domain, but need support from the Union. The Commission said that the Union should give grants to states for functions that are broadly in the nature of ‘overlapping functions’ and for area-specific interventions.
  Power, as a key element of infrastructure, plays a crucial role in fostering economic growth and development. The GoI has initiated a slew of reforms and policy measures over the years to improve the commercial viability of the power sector, which has been plagued by consistent losses. When the opening up of the power sector to private players in 1991 did not yield the expected results, a major revamping of the sector became necessary. First, the Central Electricity Act of 2003 prohibited State Electricity Boards (SEBs) from functioning as integrated power utilities. Second, the GoI enacted the Electricity Regulatory Commission Act, 1998, for the setting up of independent regulatory bodies, viz. the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission and the State Electricity Regulatory Commissions. The former measure of restructuring of the SEBs was aimed at promoting greater efficiency by streamlining operations of distribution, transmission, generation and trading. It was expected to promote transparency and accountability as the budgetary support extended to the power sector had to be explicitly laid out as subsidy in the state finances. The latter measure was expected to strengthen the regulatory structure of the power sector by the establishment of independent agencies responsible for setting tariffs, and promoting competition and efficiency in the activities of the electricity industry.
  The reform measures, along with others such as the Electricity Act, 2003, the National Electricity Policy, 2005, and Tariff Policy, 2006, were national initiatives to revive the power sector, which was reeling under losses. The set of measures, though separate for the Centre and the state governments, were in no way independent of each other. For instance, most states buy power from central power generating companies such as the National Thermal Power Corporation and the Power Finance Corporation. Thus, inefficiency of the power sector in the states affects not only state finances but also central finances.
  The Centre put in place financial packages that took care of the accumulated losses of state power boards but on condition of reforms. The initiatives relieved the pressure, but did not stop the continuing losses. For most of the schemes, the central government lends a major share of financial support to kick-start the reform process by way of a lump-sum grant. And for the residual cost, the states are made to raise finances by way of loans from banks or other financial institutions.
  The Accelerated Power Development Programme of the Ministry of Power in the year 2000–01 focused on strengthening distribution network and restructuring utilities at the distribution-circle level, all across the nation. In 2002–03, the GoI introduced the Accelerated Power Development and Reform Programme (APDRP), a scheme of incentives linked to efficiency improvement. The focus of the programme was narrowed down from the entire country to high-density urban and industrial areas for achieving quick results. Since APDRP too was not fully effective across the nation, the continuance of the programme beyond the Tenth Plan demanded further scrutiny and improvements in certain areas to make it more effective. Restructured Accelerated Power Development and Reform Programme was thus recommended in the Eleventh Plan and implemented as a CSS in 2008 with focus on actual, demonstrable performance to achieve sustained loss reduction and establishment of reliable and automated data.
  However, these reforms have not resulted in a financial turnaround of DISCOMs. In November 2015, the Ministry of Power introduced Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY). The UDAY scheme is also focused on financial turnaround of state-owned power distribution companies. Under this scheme, participating states would have to take over 75 per cent of the DISCOM debt as on 30 September 2015 in the fiscal year 2015–16 and 2016–17. This will be over and above the fiscal deficit target specified under the FRBM Act. The incentive structure is to provide states with additional funding through Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana, Integrated Power Development Scheme, Power Sector Development Fund or other such schemes of the Ministry of Power and the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy on achieving operational milestones as specified. A major downside or fiscal risk in this case is large debt exposure and consequent servicing obligations states have to undertake. Even after UDAY, if the DISCOMs continue to have poor financial health, it would further weaken the states’ fiscal position through higher subsidies to the DISCOMs and a decade of fiscal prudence may disappear, adversely affecting the fiscal space for development spending.
New Setting
A new setting for Union–state relations was ushered in when the Planning Commission, originally established in March 1950, was wound up in August 2014. NITI Aayog came into existence in January 2015; the Fourteenth Finance Commission gave its recommendations in December 2014. The recommendations have, by many accounts, far reaching consequences. The core recommendations have been accepted in full, but no decisions have been taken on some. So, we have an unfinished agenda.
  The constitutional amendment facilitating the Goods and Services Tax has been passed recently. It introduces a new dynamic to Union–state relations. The amendment provides for the setting up of the GST Council, a body with representatives of the Union and the states, with joint responsibility for some aspects of design of taxation in an overlapping tax base. This Council was set up on 12 September 2016. This mandated involvement of the Union and the states is likely to have a profound influence on the politics and economics of both. It may affect the inter-se position of the states in dealing with the Union. So, we have potentially a new dynamic and a new balance in Union–state relations.
  A panel has been appointed (chairman: N.K. Singh) to review the working of the FRBM Act over the past twelve years and recommend measures on the general government deficit. General government deficit means the deficits of the Union and the states put together. What this panel says will affect the relative shares of both in access to public debt. Currently, the Union and each state have its FRBM, and they are consistent with what the Finance Commissions have recommended. The panel’s recommendation has the potential to alter the fiscal package contemplated by the Fourteenth Finance Commission.
  The Union government has constituted a committee to examine the desirability and feasibility of having a new financial year (chairman: Shankar Acharya). The committee is required to work out the modalities for effecting the change, in case a change is recommended. The modalities include changes in the coverage of the recommendations of the Finance Commission.
  The Union government has been liberal in permitting the state governments to have their own legislation prevail over central legislation; land acquisition and labour laws are the best examples. This approach is of great significance, though the subjects so far considered indicate political compulsion more than a well worked-out approach. This gives an opening for a new agenda in Union–state relations.
Unfinished and New Agenda
With the establishment of the NITI Aayog and the acceptance of the core recommendations of the Fourteenth Finance Commission, an agenda for rebalancing the Union–state relations has been set. Recommendations relating to cooperative federalism and some of the suggestions on the fiscal consolidation road map have yet to be acted upon.
  The GST introduces a new dynamic to Union–state relations. It demands a level of cooperation between the Union and all states that is unparalleled in our history. The recently constituted GST Council, consisting of the Union and state finance ministers, is vested with the powers to make recommendations to the Union and the states on relevant matters. Virtually, the design of tax is to be agreed upon in GST and the Union and the states are expected to act based on that. The weight for a state does not vary based on size or economic strength. The remedies in the case of non-compliance with recommendations and disputes on interpretation are, understandably, not clear at this stage. In brief, a new dynamic has given birth to a new challenge, and fruits of success are high and chances of frictions not low, especially when more than two-thirds of state revenues comes from indirect taxes and the right to taxation will now be shared with the Union.
  Cooperative federalism will be put to the test in the functioning of the GST Council. It will also be put to the test when both the Union and each state have to enact laws as recommended by the Council. Above all, there is the need for harmonization of tax laws, rules, administration, a common IT backbone and continuing cooperation between the Union and state tax authorities. The introduction of GST demands a new era in Union–state fiscal relations based on trust and mutual cooperation. Moreover, development of a common market requires cooperation and trust on the issue of dual control, rate of GST and special provisions provided in the GST law.
  The Union government has indicated its willingness to get presidential assent to bills by individual states, even if some of the provisions were in conflict with an existing Union legislation. These relate to land acquisition and industrial relations, which were done due to political compulsions. However, this opens the doors for setting a new agenda with regard to reforms in the subjects listed in the Concurrent List.
  The liberalized approach to presidential assent to bills by individual states should be viewed as a recognition of the need to empower the states and enable them to carry on reform. In fact, the recent initiatives could be integrated into a new agenda for rebalancing Union–state relations that combines deregulation to strengthen market forces and decentralization to empower the states, which have major responsibility for providing most of the public goods.
  A new agenda combining deregulation (increasing scope for market forces) and decentralization (increasing decision-making powers at subnational levels of government) would involve a review of all important Union laws in the Concurrent List, a review in which the Union and all states are involved.7 It should identify those state legislative actions that have spillover effects on other states. For the rest, presidential assent to a bill by the state could be assured if it is in conformity with the underlying principle of the reform. Each state will then have an opportunity to take the best of Union law and adopt it to suit its requirements. In the process, political support of states to reforms can be reinforced. The new agenda for decentralization has advantages of de-risking, enabling diversity and meeting varied expectations of public service in different parts of the country.
  In conclusion, the evolving decentralized setting and its institutional framework in the country must take note of the changing role of the Union and states in fiscal and macroeconomic management. Greater role of states in the pursuit of decentralized development should not undermine the role that the Union government has to play in maintaining macroeconomic stability. One also cannot undermine the role of the Union government on expenditure functions having positive externalities and on key national priorities. Hopefully, the emerging framework of Union–state fiscal relations will balance these needs and priorities in a manner that follows the principle of subsidiarity in a framework of cooperative federalism.

Energizing the States
Laveesh Bhandari1
A basic foundation has been set up for state governments to manage the political economy of change. The states have not been mere spectators, or mere beneficiaries of central government reforms. They have themselves attempted changes in policy, implementation or administration of their own, and benefited from the result.
Introduction
Prior to 1991, Indian states were operating under the same constitutional framework as they do now; they operated with the same tools as they do now. Moreover, states continue to retain a large public sector, attempt many direct state-driven welfare initiatives and continue to subsume markets in a similar manner as before. At one level, nothing has changed, apart from the noticeable improvements in prosperity and income levels across the country. But that is only on the surface; even though the economic reforms have been in patches, ongoing and with much back and forth, they have deeply changed a significant part of Indian political economy.
  This essay illustrates the successes and the hurdles with the help of a few cases. Improved literacy rates, improved rural road infrastructure, and the rapid spread of cellular infrastructure and usage are undoubtedly among the major successes of the post-reforms years. At the same time, agricultural markets could have been better served had reforms occurred more rapidly in that area; similarly, the Single-Window Clearance Mechanism (SWCM) was set up in most states but, frequently, is just a façade; in the power sector too, though some change has occurred, the key elements require greater efforts.
  Using these instances, this essay makes the point that a deep and irreversible transformation in the mindset has occurred within state governments. Even in areas where reform has not occurred to the desired extent, there is a noticeable inclination towards greater economic freedom, though within the constraints of political feasibility. This change shows not only in the actions of the political leadership but also within the bureaucracy. Though the economics literature has not yet found robust results on convergence between states, we have enough evidence to show that higher growth rates are spread across most states including those not so well endowed in resources or human capital. This growth has also helped generate greater government revenues, which have enabled both the state and central governments to institute new development/welfare programmes. At the same time, greater openness has allowed access to new technologies, which have had their own impact.
  There have been many iconic chief ministers who have led their administrations and attempted to change things that few did in the two decades prior to the reforms. This note will neither name them nor contrast or compare them. However, there is an evident change in the way states operate in India today that is not limited to a single political configuration. Greater search for investment, proclivity to announce new projects, a sustained dialogue on the delivery of welfare schemes and the need for greater employment have become common objects of the citizen–politician interface across India.
  Embracing private initiative to achieve political economic objectives is no longer anathema or a last resort, despite the modest (at best) success of public–private partnerships (PPPs). Two objectives become paramount across all states in India—growth and welfare. Given the way the nation works, a few decades may elapse before the full force of decentralization and market orientation plays out, but what is difficult to deny is that the new era has been established firmly across different tiers of governance.
  This essay proceeds as follows:
1. It first reviews how growth played out across the states and makes the case that the benefits of higher growth ensuing post-1991 were well spread and generated greater revenues, which were also reflected in state government finances.
2. It then reviews how three great but largely unsung achievements of the reform process impacted both productivity and incomes, but lack of data and robust analysis has not enabled us to fully comprehend their importance.
3. Finally, it uses the examples of agriculture markets, the power sector and the public sector to make the point that many areas have opened up for the states, and they have even set the stage for the next most important leap in these areas.
Growth and Resources
Focusing purely on the impact of reforms on state-level economic growth is not easy, as states have had different strategies and resource bases. For instance, while the Green Revolution benefited the states of Punjab and Haryana, service-sector reforms naturally benefited Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Delhi more. Studies using data predominantly from the 1990s and the early years of the near millennium found an increase in growth inequality between states.2 Using later data, Kar et al. found a bi-modality, where different states appeared to be attracted to different growth paths.3 Human development indices, however, did not show the same increase in regional inequality as incomes, thus supporting the view that this may be a short-term adjustment phenomenon. The conclusion that liberalization does not necessarily leave poorer states behind received further impetus in the 2000s, when the growth rates of states such as UP, Odisha, Chhattisgarh and Bihar accelerated.
  It is difficult for econometric studies to decipher whether states are converging or diverging because of two critical reasons. Convergence is mostly a long-term process, and such studies are unable to adequately incorporate locational proximity in their analyses. For instance, the growth of Gujarat and Delhi would benefit Rajasthan within no less than a few decades. Similarly, higher growth in Delhi would naturally benefit Haryana and western UP, but for the growth to spread, adequate time will need to elapse. This trickle ‘across’ is difficult to capture but, arguably, would be an important contributor to convergence.
Table 1 suggests a somewhat weak correlation between decadal growth rates. A state-by-state analysis suggests that while a combination of circumstances and state-government actions can push a state on a path of higher growth for some time, the state might not necessarily remain there for long. As conditions change, states need to change their own focus; some, such as Punjab, did in the 1960s but could not in the 1990s. Yet others like Gujarat and Tamil Nadu could benefit more from the reforms than others such as West Bengal or Karnataka, because they responded better to changed circumstances. Arguably, states that are more flexible are more likely to remain on the high-growth path.

Growth is one dimension of success; increased access to resources is another. Through the last two and a half decades, greater resources have been made available to the states in a number of ways; for instance, the Eleventh, Twelfth and Thirteenth Finance Commissions each increased the states’ share of taxes marginally, but the Fourteenth increased it by a significant 10 percentage points. Together, these have enabled states to maintain and improve their fisc, despite the great burdens imposed on them by increased welfare, subsidies and various pay commissions (see Table 2).
Three Successes
The reforms and consequent growth created extra resources that allowed India to speed up three significant initiatives—the objective of universal literacy through Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA); universal rural road connectivity through the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY); and widespread penetration of rural telephony at low cost to the consumer. Kale and Bhandari pointed out that the high growth rates post 2005 would not have sustained for so long were it not for these three successes of post-reforms India.
  To put it another way, India has surpassed aggregate literacy levels of 80 per cent (see discussion below), connected rural residents to a well-spread road infrastructure and empowered them through access to communications, including the internet, at relatively low costs. One would expect all these factors to have had tremendous impact on rural productivity, but unfortunately, due to a lack of long and thorough data on capital stock in India, the increase in total factor productivity cannot be captured accurately.
  Circumstantial evidence, however, reports the same—an increased proclivity to go back to school among manual workers; a lack of major production disasters despite poor agriculture seasons in 2009 and again in 2013–15; sustained high-growth levels in rural areas—all of which strongly indicate (though admittedly not prove) that a very deep change had occurred in the agriculture sector and rural India.
Literacy
First, consider basic literacy. Between 1991 and 2011, literacy levels went up from 52.21 per cent to 74.04 per cent—adult literacy rate (fifteen years and above) improved from 61 per cent in 2001 to 69.3 per cent in 2011—and are expected to cross 80 per cent by 2016 (census figures and author estimates). This has occurred largely due to the expansion of the SSA. Table 3 shows how various elementary-stage indicators improved rapidly.
  Table 3: Elementary Education Indicators, All India
 
Source: Statistics of School Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India.
One of the most significant impacts of SSA has been a considerable decrease in dropout rates. According to the Statistics of School Education (SES), the dropout rates for primary stage showed very little decline during the period of 1990–91 to 2000–01, from 42.6 per cent to 40.7 per cent respectively. However, after 2000–01, when the SSA was launched, the dropout rate among primary school going children declined from 40.7 per cent in 2000–01 to 25.7 per cent in 2005–06. Similar decline in the dropout rate has been observed at the upper-primary stage of education. SSA has also been a boon for girls’ education. All of this augurs well for the sustainability of demographic and economic changes and for the future in general.
  At the same time, no one can deny the poor quality of education being imparted in Indian primary schools. Much has been written on the matter, especially since the release of ASER data since 2006 about the less-than-satisfactory learning achievements of Indian schoolchildren. While the glass may be only partially full, it is significantly better than before.
Rural Roads
Let’s look at PMGSY (see Table 4). The programme has been driven by the Centre, but its implementation falls under the state governments’ ambit. As per the PMGSY 2014–15 Annual Report data, the number of habitations connected by the PMGSY increased from 13,687 in 2000–04 to 77,877 in 2010–11 and to 1,08,637 in 2014–15. However, the pace appears to have increased since, with 65 per cent of rural habitations expected to have been connected by 2015, another 17 per cent sanction has occurred and the remaining (18 per cent) is expected to be covered by 2019.4 This is not simply about connecting villages with each other, but also to the closest market; this is not only an initiative in human interest, but has tremendous economic implications as well.

Nearly all state governments contracted out the task of building roads to private parties. Despite the risk of corruption and lack of capacity in the state line departments for such a massive project, a moderate- to good-quality road network has been laid out and is expanding rapidly. Moreover, despite the presence of interstate variations, the maintenance of these roads has been a welcome change from the past, when rural roads were known for their poor quality.
Telecommunications
Finally, the telecom sector (see Table 5). This change has been largely due to investments and efforts in the private sector but was primarily achieved through farsighted central government policy and regulation. Even state governments provided rare support to the private entities and their contractors. As per ITU (International Telecommunication Unit) data, between 2001 and 2011 the percentage of households with telecom connections increased from 9 per cent to 63 per cent and further crossed 81 per cent by 2015.

But wide dispersion is not the most important part of the story. It was achieved with no subsidies and at low cost for the user (see Table 6). The tariff rates are much lower than the maximum rates specified by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), which only goes to show the success of competitive forces in the sector.

The ITU provides international comparisons that further underscore the same (see Table 7). The reforms have enabled a great combination of competition and regulation, and together, they have enabled rapid expansion and coverage and low cost.
  Table 7: Low Telecom Rates
 
Source: ITU; see: PS: http://www.itu.int/en/ITU D/Statistics/Pages/publications/wtid.aspx
It is sometimes claimed by many that the telecom network was easier to create because it was largely wireless. That is not entirely the case: telecom towers need to be put up in the vicinity of large population centres and are susceptible to the same forces that beset any infrastructure. In this case, the pressure for cellular connectivity was not only driven from the top, but from the ground up as well. The greater demand was natural, given the low cost and great accessibility to the consumer. The state governments actively contributed and supported the rapid roll-out of telecom tower construction, enabled land for setting up cable networks and supported the need for the security of the large network of unmanned towers in the hinterlands.
Illustrations of Partial Measures
At the same time, state governments across the country have attempted other changes that have not played out fully, as a result of which their full benefits have not been realized. We take up the cases of Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs), the Single-Window Clearance Mechanism (SWCM) for setting up manufacturing facilities, and reforms in the power sector as illustrations.
  While it is easy to criticize the inaction of state governments and their inability to manage the political economy of change, it is also true that a basic foundation has been set up wherever possible. As opposition to change reduces with time, state governments should be able to institute many more of the most important changes.
Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC)
As per the Budget for the year 2014–15, there are 2477 principal regulated markets in India and another 4843 sub-market yards that are regulated by an APMC located nearby. While each state government needs to have its own legislative framework for agriculture, the practice typically has been one where the central government provides a general direction that most states follow with minor changes. In line with this, the central government came up with a model APMC Act in 2004, which has since then been followed by most states (see accompanying table).
  The APMC is a marketing board for agricultural produce set up by state governments. APMCs are established in all the states in the country, and they are aimed at providing incentives to produce farmers, correcting market failures and augmenting social welfare.
  The original intention of the APMC-regulated markets was to protect the farmers from intermediaries and provide them a place where they could sell their produce at appropriate prices through competitive bidding. However, as per the government mandate that trade can only occur in such markets, the APMCs have also been taken over by powerful colluding interests through brokers and other middlemen. Though debatable, it is often argued that the problem is more severe with items such as cash crops, fruits and vegetables, for which minimum support prices do not exist as a benchmark for the seller.
  The objective of the 2004 APMC Model Act, therefore, was to free the farmer from the stranglehold of these colluding interest groups. This was only possible if the farmer was allowed to sell at any location and to any entity of his choice. This would also require direct transactions between seller and buyer and not necessarily carried out within the APMC marketplace. A level of protection to the farmer was also built-in by giving specific directions regarding market fees and receipt of payments.
  Most states have adopted some version of the new APMC Act. For instance, the Government of Haryana only adopted the contract farming provision of the Act, while Odisha decided against allowing private markets for rice. While some states such as Madhya Pradesh adopted the provision that called for abolishing the commission agent system, several other states have not done the same.5 In addition, some of the features of the Model APMC Act failed to create a single national- or state-level common market. This includes the fact that the Model APMC Act retains the clause under which buyers are required to pay APMC charges even when they buy agricultural produce outside the APMC area. Together, these two would arguably have benefited the farmer the most by introducing stronger competitive elements in the agriculture marketplace. In other words, the need to protect the farmer by limiting their freedom overwhelmed the recognition that farmers needed greater choice in their decision to sell. However, recent efforts, since 2013, have aimed to create a National Agriculture Market (NAM) where mandis, or marketplaces, are integrated electronically across the country. This could, to some extent, fill the missing gaps of the Model Act of 2004.
Single-Window Clearance Mechanism (SWCM)
The single-window mechanism is defined as the establishment of a single point of contact, typically for all manufacturing or other start-ups, so that entrepreneurs don’t have to visit multiple departments for various clearances, ensuring easier and faster setup of industries.
  Multiple permissions required for setting up a business is a known global phenomenon. In India, however, the combination of complex and redundant laws, an unresponsive and unmotivated bureaucracy, and extremely poor land records further add to the problem. Consequently, a single window, where an entrepreneur can obtain all required permissions in one go, is a welcome concept. It is, however, not merely a location. It is a concept where multiple applications are rendered unnecessary because of coordinated information-gathering by government departments. Moreover, this coordinated approach, in an ideal world, would also remove the necessity of many permissions and the need to apply for them. In short, a single window, if done in the right spirit, can make entry costs far lower than they are.
  A good single-window mechanism would require the setting up of a dedicated (formal or informal) group—anything from an investment promotion agency or the industries department of the state government. Several states have already set up single-window mechanisms for promoting investment and industries, while many have also provided a legal backing to this initiative. Table 8 briefly reviews the differences between states.

Despite the fact that most states have implemented some version of the SWCM and have benefited from it, field evidence suggests not much has improved over the years. The manufacturing sector’s long-term stagnation has not been controlled—apart from a few islands in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu—and much more is required for the sector to lead India’s economic growth. A critical factor in this modest success of the SWCM is its still-prevalent pre-1991 administrative requirements. Once that changes, much more would be possible.
  There is little consensus on which states have performed better on the SWCM front; relevant studies are typically conducted based on perceptions, limited to a few sectors, and their results are not comparable across states. Though what is now evident is that a well-motivated bureaucracy is only a small part of the story; underlying structures where processes and rules have been defined in a rather straight-jacketed manner and limited bureaucratic freedom are forcing state governments’ line departments and businesses to circumvent the requirements as much as is possible.
  Despite all these flaws, a common window has made one fact clear: each state government is keen to attract investment and is willing to go the extra mile required to make things easier for investors. This is a far cry from the days of licensing. What remains is the painstaking task of clearing the laws, rules and requirements on a line by line basis. And there are rumblings across the board: Rajasthan has loosened the controversial Industrial Disputes Act as well, along with some of its archaic labour laws, and is going through a systematic reappraisal of all its laws; reportedly, Maharashtra has started the process as well.
Power
In the year 2003, the Government of India enacted the Electricity Act that replaced the existing legal structure of the power sector. This included the Electric Supply Act of 1948 and the Electricity Regulatory Commissions (ERC) Act of 1998. Prior to the Electricity Act of 2003, some states had already unbundled their SEBs. The central government’s action followed some (arguably half-hearted) efforts by state governments of Odisha, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Delhi and Madhya Pradesh, who had already unbundled their SEBs.
  Table 9: Technical and Commercial Losses of State Power Utilities
 
Source: Annual Reports on the Working of State Power Utilities and Electricity Departments (relevant years), Planning Commission, Government of India.
A State Electricity Regulatory Commission was envisaged for each state to act as independent regulator that would have the following functions among others:
1. Determine tariffs of generation, supply, transmission
2. Ensure intra-state transmission
3. Advise state governments on reforming the sector
4. Regulate electricity purchase and procurement of the distribution licensees
Though unbundling by itself would not achieve much, it is the first step towards better governance, monitoring and the eventual possibility of greater private presence in the sector. An empowered state regulator guards against the possibility of monopoly rents. Though most states have unbundled the power sector, only two, Delhi and Odisha, have gone in for privatization. In other words, the basic work done, various constraints got in the way of further effort, like the state governments’ lack of capacity to guarantee independent, skilled and credible regulatory functions (see Tables 9 and 10).
Distribution reforms in the power sector involved two parts. First was the introduction of the Multi Year Tariff system, which potentially reduces the uncertainty in returns and helps in long-term planning and improved ability to access funds. However, given that distribution has largely remained in the public sector with state budgetary support on tap, this advantage has not been realized significantly. The second is the Open Access Regulations (OAR), which enable non-discriminatory access by any licensee or consumer, including those involved in captive electricity generation. The hurdles currently are a set of regulations determined by state and central transmission utilities and regulators at both the central and state levels, based on the least technological capacity of the lines. The current status, therefore, is that though the stage is set for open access, there is very little of it currently because of inappropriate regulations and also the lack of capacities in the current distribution infrastructure. Once the OAR becomes operational, a completely new and highly competitive regime can be operationalized in the power sector.

  To put it differently, there has been some, albeit limited, movement at the state level; however, there are three forces that have prevented further action in most states: the political economy and the fear of monopolization; the lack of state-level capacity (or lack of confidence in the available human resources that can adequately manage the new market-oriented regime), and poor infrastructure.
Concluding Note
The states have not been mere spectators or beneficiaries of central government reforms; they too have attempted changes in policy and improved implementation, and have benefited from such efforts. Some of these have been under direction from the central government, some have been seeded by a demand for change, and others have been the result of technological forces that overwhelmed inaction. In other words, any change has had to go through political and bureaucratic leadership that has sometimes proactively supported and sometimes inactively opposed it.
  The critical and obvious questions are: Where did the states do well in bringing about change? And where did they not? There are five characteristics where change has been unambiguously promoted by state government administrations.
  The first is when there is clarity of objective emanating from the central government. This was most prevalent in SSA, PMGSY and telecom. The central government’s intentions, policy changes and resource allocations were all in sync, with a clearly defined agenda. But this was not necessarily the case in, say, the APMC act or Single-Window Mechanism, where the central government itself was not keen on taking the tough calls related to correcting the Essential Commodities Act, or land and labour regulations.
  The second critical characteristic was related to capacities within the state governments. The new regime required greater capacities within the state governments to deal with the private sector. Whether in electricity, regulation or PPPs, the lack of capacities hindered many large and small changes. Change is always easier to bring about when a different set of capacities is not required within the state government.
  The third characteristic was a demand for change. The SSA, for all its flaws, succeeded in reaching most students when the Midday Meal was tied with it. The Midday Meal Scheme provides primary school students with a free meal when they are in school, universally. Therefore, it intimately tied a supply-driven initiative (schooling) to a demand-driven one (free food). Similarly, both rural roads and telecom benefited everyone, and almost uniformly so, and had tremendous public pressure from the outset.
  The fourth characteristic is access to funds. In all cases where the central government has driven change, funds have been relatively easier to access for the state governments. Important requirements, such as building of irrigation infrastructure, were rarely taken up. Similarly, investment in cities has been negligible across all states, despite a rapid deterioration of living conditions among the poor and recent in-migrants. There has been a tremendous lack of initiative on resource generation by most state governments. It is difficult to tell whether it is simply a political-economic setup with a short-term vision or lack of capacity for bringing about difficult change.
  Finally, change where the government plays the role of a provider appears to be more frequent and successful than one where it is an equal participant in the economy. It would be easy to identify the political setup as the main culprit. However, it is also true that the government in India uses levers of control designed to meet colonial requirements, and it is difficult for large segments of the government to give away their powers, even if they are market forces.
  The way forward is also quite clear: if the benefits of higher growth trickle down slowly, so does the reform process. Much more remains to be done at the state level in limiting government intervention, in facilitating greater decentralization to the local government level, in improving accountability of the governments’ own functionaries.

25 Years of Policy Tinkering in Agriculture
Ashok Gulati, Shweta Saini
Agriculture was never a part of the comprehensive agenda for reforms. The overarching trade and marketing policies in India have remained restrictive and anti-farmer. A forward-looking vision is needed, one that is science-based, aligned to market forces, and backed by ample financial resources operating in a global framework.
Backdrop
India’s economic reforms started in July 1991 in the backdrop of a severe economic crisis. Abysmally low levels of foreign exchange (in June 1991, reserves plummeted to less than $1.2 billion that were sufficient for meeting import needs of only two weeks); sticky and high double-digit inflation (yearly inflation stood at 17 per cent); unsustainably high levels of fiscal deficit (combined fiscal deficit of Centre and states in fiscal year 1991 was about 10 per cent of GDP) and current-account deficit (crossed 3 per cent of GDP) drove the ailing economy to the inevitability of undertaking economic reforms in 1991.
  Even though there were efforts made prior to 1991, it was only at the cusp of the major crisis that the country’s economic systems reformed in a more holistic and a transformational manner. However, unlike the widespread global and national notion, the 1991 economic reforms were not exclusively attributable to IMF’s strategy. It was the thought leadership and proactive thinking of seasoned technocrats and economists such as Dr Manmohan Singh, Montek Singh Ahluwalia and others that laid the road map of economic reforms for the country much before July 1991.
  The unexpected death of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in December 1989 derailed the country’s political and reform agenda. The two successive governments following this incident lasted less than a year. By the time Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao was sworn in on 21 June 1991, the country was deep-rooted in its economic crisis. Dr Manmohan Singh was asked to join the newly formed government as its Union Minister of Finance. His lecture at IIM-Bangalore, which was delivered just a few months before he joined the government, was on similar lines and formed a good academic base for the strategy he deployed going forward and as revealed in his Union Budget presented on 24 July 1991, along with the industrial policy reforms announced on the same day.
  As special secretary to Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and later to Prime Minister V.P. Singh, Montek Singh Ahluwalia authored a note titled ‘Restructuring India’s Industrial and Trade Policies’, popularly referred to as the M-document, in June 1990. In light of the evolving economic situation in the country, the document detailed the structural reforms that the country needed to undertake on an urgent basis. This document later became the basis for much of the reform strategies outlined in July 1991.
  The 1991 policy package that ushered in economic reforms comprised primarily of three components:
1. Correction of exchange rate: rupee was first devalued by 24 per cent in quick succession in July 1991, and then by March 1993, rupee was made to fully float in the market.
2. Reduction in industrial tariffs: trade-policy changes were ushered in with a view to reduce the industrial tariffs from about 100 per cent to 30–40 per cent gradually and reducing peak tariffs from 200 per cent to about 65 per cent.
3. De-licensing of a large number of industries (except a list of eighteen, which were reserved for security reasons).
It is notable that agriculture was never a part of this comprehensive agenda for reforms. The current paper evaluates this by tracing and evaluating the policy reforms that have influenced the country’s agriculture sector, even though haphazardly. The paper structure is as follows: Section II discusses the impact of the 1991 macroeconomic reforms, especially exchange rate and reduction in industrial tariffs, on agriculture. Section III traces policy reforms in subsequent years, especially on fertilizer-price policy and agriculture trade policies. Section IV compares Indian economic reforms, particularly in the agriculture sector, with that of China. In light of the impact that the two different approaches have on poverty, lessons are drawn. After discussing the current challenges affecting the country’s agriculture sector, the last section proposes a package of reforms for making the sector competitive, inclusive and sustainable going forward.
Impact of the 1991 Exchange-rate Adjustments and Lowering Industrial Tariffs on Agriculture
Despite significant successes in agriculture during the late 1960s and 1970s, which gave India its Green Revolution (wheat) and White Revolution (milk), overarching trade and marketing policies remained restrictive and anti-farmer. On the one hand, the country’s overvalued exchange rate taxed its otherwise globally competitive agriculture sector, and on the other, the exceptionally high import duties on industrial commodities discriminated against the farm sector.
  Pursell and Gulati, in fact, quantify this degree of anti-agriculture bias in India over a long period. Their analysis suggests that, on an average, Indian agriculture was discriminated against to the tune of about 20–30 per cent of the value of the agri output. This was equivalent to an implicit tax imposed on agriculture due to overvalued exchange rate and heavy protection to industry.
  Therefore, the twin reforms correcting the overvalued exchange rate (that was first devalued and, later, the system was made to float in the market) and gradual reduction in industrial tariffs reduced the long-existing anti-agriculture bias in the system. This gave agriculture an immediate boost, but to tap the full potential gains from these macroeconomic reforms, there was a continuing need to reform the sector’s trade regime, which was highly restrictive. Several agricultural commodities, mainly food, were subject to stringent export and import controls. Because of the deep-rooted problems of food insecurity and poverty, and the historic mindset of the policymakers (which have indelible impressions of the country’s devastating experiences during famines and droughts), these reforms did materialize, albeit with severe caution and thinly spread over a long period. These reforms were mostly ad hoc and unpredictable in nature, oscillating between a free and controlled trading regime.
  Nevertheless, on a priori basis, one would expect at least three things from these macroeconomic reforms that should favour agriculture in the medium to long term. One, with major exchange-rate adjustments, agriculture should emerge as an exportable sector, and if exports of agriculture gradually opened up, though with hiccups, at least it should reflect in the improved agri-exports performance over time. Two, with falling tariffs on industrial goods, the relative prices between agriculture and the manufacturing sector should turn in favour of agriculture; and three, private-sector investments in agriculture, if they respond to relative prices, should improve and positively influence growth rates in agriculture. How did reality fare vis-à-vis these a priori hypotheses? We examine that next.
Performance of India’s Agri Exports and Imports
The share of India’s agriculture exports in global agri exports rose from less than 1 per cent in 1990–91 to 2.6 per cent by 2013–14. Overall, agri trade (exports plus imports), which was less than 5 per cent of agri GDP (AGDP) in 1990–91 stood at almost 20 per cent by 2013–14 (see Graph 1). There has been some moderation in trade in the recent years of FY 2015 and FY 2016 mainly on two accounts: falling domestic supplies due to two consecutive droughts in 2014 and 2015 and plummeting global prices affecting India’s global competitiveness. Despite these, the country’s agri trade was still at 17.6 per cent of its AGDP in FY 2016.
  Not surprisingly, India, despite being a net importer on its overall trade account for all commodities, is a net exporter of agriculture to the rest of the world (see Graph 1). Overall, Indian agri exports in FY 2014 crossed $42 billion as against imports of about $16 billion, giving a net trade surplus of about $26 billion. This is the highest-ever trade surplus that Indian agri trade has generated.
  In anticipation of transmission of global volatile food prices, during the global food crisis of 2007–08, to domestic markets, India banned its wheat and rice exports. The bans were finally lifted in September 2011. While there was a complete wheat ban between February 2007 and September 2011, rice faced a more general ban between October 2007 and September 2011, where its trade policy fluctuated between minimum export prices (MEPs) and bans. Since September 2011, however, the rice and wheat exports have surged and in the three years between 2012–13 and 2014–15, India exported about 62 MMT (million metric tonne) of cereals to the world. Market-based exchange rates1 have undeniably played a significant role in this rising agri-trade surplus.

In this regard, it is interesting to note that the findings from estimates of the Balassa Index of Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA)2 suggest that Indian agriculture outshines other sectors of the country on a global platform. With higher estimates of RCA than the manufacturing sector and commercial services (M & CS), agriculture sector establishes its comparative edge. Across time and within a year, the agriculture sector has been gaining greater competitiveness relative to the other two sectors. For example, between 2011 and 2014, the RCA for M & CS was around 1.05, but for agriculture, it improved from 1.06 to 1.24 (see Table 1). In 2014, the RCA value for agriculture was 1.24, while that for manufacturing or even for the combined M & CS, it was 0.8 and 1.05 respectively.

In the three years between 2012–13 and 2014–15, India exported close to 62 MMT cereals in global markets and 78 per cent of this, i.e., more than 48 MMT, was only rice and wheat. Cereals have clearly emerged as an important component of India’s agri-trade basket. Back in 1991–92, cereals and cereal preparations had a share of 9.83 per cent in total agro exports and in FY 2015, the share of rice alone was 20.4 per cent. About 60 per cent of India’s agricultural exports basket in FY 2015 comprised rice, meat, marine products, spices and cotton.
Relative Terms of Trade for Indian Agriculture
The relative price index3 (with the base 2004–05 = 100) between the agriculture and manufacturing sectors has witnessed a secular upward trend. The index touched a low of eighty-nine in 1993–94. However, it has improved since then, reaching 157 by 2014–15. A major part of this improvement started from 2004–05 onwards, when the new government decided to reduce the gap between low domestic prices and high global agriculture prices. Increases in the procurement prices or the minimum support prices (MSPs) of wheat and rice, along with several other agri commodities, became one of the conduits for this, particularly since 2007. The year coincided with the launch of the National Food Security Mission (NFSM) domestically and the onset of food price eruption globally. Thus, on the one hand, the government undertook a mission under NFSM to increase domestic foodgrain production by 20 MMT in the next five years, and this necessitated an aggressive increase in MSPs; on the other hand, the global food crisis of 2007–08 widened the gap between the domestic and global prices. Consequently, to draw parity between the domestic and global prices and to incentivize the producers to produce more, the government increased MSPs strategically to catch up with world prices over a three- to four-year period. Intermediate events of bans in 2007–11 delayed the process, but over a medium- to long-term period, the two prices do appear to have converged.
  Several economists blamed the aggressive hikes in MSPs during 2007–08 and 2012 on the high and sticky double-digit food inflation that the country suffered, mainly between FY 2009 and FY 2013. The myopia inherent in the view above is evident from the historical trends in domestic prices that have over time followed their global counterparts. This is largely true for at least rice and wheat that have suffered the most because of ad hoc trade restrictions and bans. Imposing bans can at best delay the transmission of the global volatility to domestic markets but cannot stall it for good.
  Interestingly, despite undergoing the recent aggressive growth trend, Indian MSPs are much lower than the support prices given by some of its global competitors. Even in 2014–15, Indian MSPs of rice and wheat were below most of the comparable countries in the region of south and south-east Asia, especially China, that India aspires to compete with. For example, India’s rice MSP (converted from paddy MSP) was $330/MT, while in China it was $440/MT for Indica rice and $505/MT for Japonica rice (see Graph 2).

With MSP levels below international levels, the country displayed its inherent consumer bias. The recent upward correction was a necessity for the country to support a farmer who was suffering because of relatively lower MSPs and limited global market access. Exclusively blaming the hike in MSPs for raising food prices is not just naïve but is also indicative of the anti-farmer mindset that the country has conveniently nurtured over the years. Upon undertaking a quantitative exercise (for the period 1995–95 to 2012–13) to determine the factors that drove up the sticky food prices, we found high food inflation explained by three factors: exuberantly high fiscal deficits (Centre and states), high and growing agri-labour wage rates, and rising global prices.
  The orchestrated fiscal stimulus given by all countries, including India, in response to the global crisis of 2007–08, catapulted the country’s fiscal deficit from 4 per cent of GDP in 2007–08 to 8 per cent in the two years of 2008 and 2009. The average M3 growth rate in the years between 2008–09 and 2012–13 was about 17 per cent. Even nominal wages in the farm sector were rising by around 18 per cent, and real wages at around 7 per cent per annum during the last years of UPA-I (and much of the UPA-II period), which added to the costs of production, thus pushing up food prices.
Private Investments in Agriculture
Capital formation in agriculture by the private sector (primarily farmers) responds, inter alia, to two things: relative incentive structure between agriculture and industry as captured by their relative prices and to public-sector investments in agriculture (under the complementarity hypothesis).
  Graph 3 shows the evolving trends in the country’s gross capital formation in agriculture. Two structural changes emerge in this graph. One, the share of private investments in overall investments in agriculture, which was almost half in early 1980s, had grown to almost 85 per cent by 2013–14, making the public investments’ share very marginal (only 15 per cent). Second, driven by this trend of growing private investments, overall investments in agriculture as a share of AGDP, which hovered around 10–12 per cent in the early 1990s, rose to almost 20 per cent by 2013–14.

Performance of AGDP
The impact of all these factors on AGDP growth has been mixed. India’s agriculture GDP grew by 4.1 per cent per annum during the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2007–11), up from about 2.5 per cent per annum during the ten years preceding this plan (1998–2007). This period of growth in agriculture maps with the period that witnessed the fastest rate of poverty reduction in the country. During the period 2004–05 to 2011–12, poverty in India reduced at a rate three times faster than during 1993–94 to 2004–05. Not coincidently, this growth period was also precisely the time when relative prices moved in favour of agriculture.
  However, it is interesting to note that this growth took place despite the fact that about 53 per cent of India’s gross cropped area is still rainfed, which often causes higher uncertainty depending upon monsoon rains. A quantitative analysis of the factors that explain the historical variations in the country’s AGDP reveals interesting results. For the period between 1996–97 and 2014–15, more than 91 per cent variations in AGDP (dependent variable) were explained by three factors: relative prices (RP) with one-year lag, monsoon rainfall index (RNI), and a trend variable capturing the long-term improvements in technology. The impact of relative prices was the largest and statistically quite significant.4
Direct Reforms in Agriculture and Their Impact
We discuss in this section the major agriculture-sector reforms and the impact they have had on the sector in the twenty-five years that followed. The studied reforms will include the ones undertaken directly in agriculture, or in input prices (subsidies), or in the trade policies. Special crop-specific production programmes will also be discussed in this section.
Fertilizer Subsidy Reforms
In the July 1991 Budget, urea prices were at the first instance raised by 40 per cent but, later, on account of an uproar within the then ruling Congress party, they were rolled back to 30 per cent. The effort was to phase out large subsidies on agri inputs and get the fiscal deficit under control. In 1992, the government appointed a Joint Parliamentary Committee to look into this issue, which recommended further lowering of urea price by 10 per cent but freeing up phosphorous (P) and potash (K) fertilizers. Obviously, that did not solve the problem of fertilizer subsidy, nor did it help to correct the use of N, P and K fertilizers. Graph 4 presents the movement of maximum retail prices of various types of fertilizers from 1980–81 to 2013–14. It is clear from the graph that urea prices have been constant over a long period, while P and K prices erupted after 2010–11, when a nutrient-based subsidy scheme was accepted for P and K, but not for nitrogenous fertilizers. This has made the N, P and K balance even worse in certain regions such as Punjab and Haryana, indicating large inefficiency in the use of chemical fertilizers.
  This issue of fertilizer subsidy is still unresolved. The quantum of fertilizer subsidy ballooned suddenly in 2008–09, as global prices of chemical fertilizers increased substantially while domestic prices, especially of urea, remained frozen. As a result, the fertilizer subsidy crossed Rs 1,00,000 crore. As a percentage of AGDP, it was 10 per cent, and as a percentage of the Union government’s tax revenue, it crossed 20 per cent. It came down as the global prices receded. However, in the Union Budget of FY 2017, fertilizer subsidy expenditure is budgeted at Rs 70,000 crore, and in addition, there are pending bills of the fertilizer industry that amount to more than Rs 45,000 crore. Together, it is one of the top three subsidies that the GoI gives on food, fertilizer and fuels.Because of the extremely low prices of urea, Indian urea often finds its way to Nepal as well as to Bangladesh through informal channels and into several non-agricultural uses. This is where a lot of scope exists for future reforms—we elaborate on this in the last section. Suffice to say here that despite initial moves to streamline this issue in 1991, the problem persists, and no government has had the boldness to address this head-on.

Trade Policies on Agri Products
In 1990–91, much of Indian agriculture global trade (about 94 per cent of AGDP) was subject to many types of non-tariff barriers. These trade-restricting barriers included compulsory export and import licensing, canalization (restriction of trade through generally one parastatal body), and the use of MEPs.
  India’s agri-trade policies have been ad hoc and unpredictable. These policies have been observed to be subservient to the overall objective of food security and price stabilization for the consumer, much to the detriment of the farmers who have borne the brunt of such ad hocism due to export restrictions. A case in point is the 2007–08 global food crisis, which triggered a ban on wheat and rice exports. To illustrate the evolution in India’s agri-trade policies and their impact, we present case studies on cereals, mainly rice and wheat and on edible oils.
1. Edible Oils
The story of edible oils has to start from 1986, when India was importing about 30 per cent of its consumption requirement. It was almost the second-biggest import item after crude oil. Scarcity of foreign exchange in 1986 compelled India to set out a goal of self-sufficiency in oilseeds by 1990–91. This was a very ambitious target and to achieve this goal, the government created a Technology Mission on Oilseeds (TMO). The TMO tried its best to raise productivity and improve the marketing and processing of oilseeds, etc., but it was nowhere near its goal by the end of 1988. In January 1989, the TMO, headed by P.V. Shenoy, sought help from Dr Verghese Kurien, the famous ‘milk man of India’, who was responsible for ushering in the White Revolution in the 1970s. Dr Kurien’s first move was to stop all imports of edible oils. This led to the flaring up of domestic prices of edible oils, and about 7 million hectares of area shifted from cereals to oilseeds. India achieved almost complete self-sufficiency by 1992–93, when imports fell to less than 5 per cent of its requirements. This success was the ‘Yellow Revolution’. However, India fell short of cereals in that year and almost 3 MMT wheat had to be imported to fill the gap between domestic production and consumption requirements. There was nothing wrong in these imports except two things: the import parity price of wheat was almost double the price paid to Indian farmers as the MSP for their domestic produce and domestic prices of edible oils were at least 60–70 per cent higher than their import-parity prices. Large inefficiency in India’s allocation of resources within agriculture was loud and clear. This was communicated to the policymakers through a comprehensive paper, which set the stage for trade-policy reforms in edible oils and in the cereal sector in the subsequent years.
  In April 1994, the quantitative restrictions (QRs) on edible-oil imports were abolished and replaced by 65 per cent tariffs on palm oil, which were brought down to 30 per cent in the following year, and then to 20 per cent and then further to 15 per cent in each successive year. Initially, this did not have much impact on imports as global prices were rising, but with the onset of the East Asian crisis in 1997, several commodity prices—especially of edible oils—collapsed, and this led to rising imports of edible oils. The fear of the erasure of the ‘Yellow Revolution’ triggered demands to raise import duties. The new government succumbed to this pressure and raised import duties on palm oil from 15 per cent in 1998 to almost 75 per cent in 2001 for crude palm oil and to more than 90 per cent for refined palm oil (see Graphs 6a, 6b, 6c).
  In 2004, a new government came with Dr Manmohan Singh as the prime minister. The import duties started easing as global prices of edible oils started rising. By 2008, these duties came down to zero! Even in FY 2016, with a moderate duty, India was importing more than 50 per cent of its consumption requirement, and self-sufficiency in edible oils now seems a distant dream.

2. Cereals
Cereal exports and imports were highly restricted, primarily through the ‘canalization’ route. Exports were further restricted through high MEPs or outright QRs. The only exception was basmati rice, exports of which normally hovered below 0.5 MMT. The year 1994, which saw the change in import policy for edible oils, also saw the change in common rice exports, which were opened to the private sector without much restrictions. As a result, India emerged as the second-largest exporter of rice in 1995–96 with an export of rice close to 5 MMT (see Graph 7).
  The journey of rice exports, however, has not been very smooth. It has suffered several times—sometimes due to falling global prices but more often due to restrictive government export policy through either high MEPs or outright bans on common rice exports (as during 2007–11). Nevertheless, rice exports moved up from one peak to another and during FY 2013–2015, on an average, India exported more than 10 MMT rice and became one of the largest exporters of rice in the world (see Graph 7).
  Wheat experienced an even more restrictive export-policy regime. It faced bans during 1996–2000 and again during 2007–11. Nevertheless, like rice, wheat exports too were substantial during FY 2013 to FY 2015. In fact, during the three years from FY 2013 to FY 2015, India exported 62 MMT cereals, an annual average of more than 20 MMT. This has been the largest cereal export, a sort of ‘cereal wonder’, in India’s long history (see Graph 7).
  Gradually, over time, India opened up exports of several other agri commodities. In commodities such as cotton and beef (buffalo meat), India became the largest or second-largest exporter in FY 2014.

Despite the reforms and the impressive performance on the trade front, the policy governing some of the agri exports is still highly restrictive, especially in the case of pulses, sugar, oilseeds and edible oils. Not-so-essential commodities such as onions and potatoes are subject to sporadic bans or high MEPs; even the trade in basic cereals oscillates inter- and intra-year between trade regimes. These are elements of anti-agriculture bias that still exist, though not to the degree as it did before the 1991 reforms of exchange-rate correction and slashing of industrial tariffs.
Domestic Agri Marketing and Production–policy Reforms
Although agri commodities have national markets, the laws and practices under the Essential Commodities Act (ECA, 1955) and the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act make marketing of agri commodities less efficient and riskier. Under ECA, for example, movement of commodities can be restricted between states, or even between districts within a state; limits on private sector stocks of ‘essential commodities’ can be imposed, strangulating the role of the private players. Similarly, limited licensing of commission agents under APMC creates a ‘rent-seeking’ class of commission agents, who have oligopolistic powers and take away undue share in the value chains of most agri commodities. Future and forward markets in most agri commodities (except turmeric, pepper, potato, gur and castor seed) were banned in the pre-reforms era. Existence of a dualistic marketing system, particularly for rice and wheat, under which part of the marketed surplus of certain commodities is procured by the government (or its nodal agency called the Food Corporation of India—FCI) to be distributed to an identified vulnerable section of the society at highly subsidized prices, complicates the already strangulated agri markets. Combining this with the government’s levy system for rice and sugar, wherein the rice millers had to deposit a certain percentage of milled rice to FCI at fixed prices, further limits the efficiency of market systems. In some states, this levy ratio was as high as 70 per cent. After moderation in this ratio over the years, the government finally abolished it. In the case of sugar, the levy rate after peaking at 65 per cent in the pre-reforms era underwent moderation and was later abolished. Cotton too had a monopoly procurement scheme in Maharashtra but that too was eventually dismantled.
  All such restrictive policies increased the gap between the farm-gate prices and the retail prices, thus accentuating the anti-agriculture bias in the system and in policymaking. Most of them have been relaxed and some (like the levy system) have been phased out during the twenty-five years of the piecemeal reforms. However, the draconian ECA and APMC policies are still in place, inducing the markets with uncertainty and high risk. Quantifying the impact of all these on farmers’ incentives is a challenging task, but Gulati and Sharma (1991) calculated this for the pre-1991 reform period, and the results reinforced the presence of an anti-agriculture bias in Indian agri policies.
  On the agri-production front, two promising missions were launched during the UPA-I period, which are noteworthy. One was the National Horticulture Mission (NHM) launched in 2005–06, and the other, as already mentioned, was NFSM, launched in 2007 in response to the 6 MMT wheat imports by India in FY 2007.
  In 2007–08, NFSM had set a target to increase the country’s foodgrain production by 20 MMT in the subsequent five years, i.e., by 2011–12. In terms of the three commodities, a 20-MMT increase referred to 10 MMT rice, 8 MMT wheat and 2 MMT pulses. Supported by large increases in MSPs of wheat and rice (by almost 40 per cent within two years) and reasonably good rainfall, foodgrain production increase was more than double the target, i.e., the 2011–12 foodgrain figure was higher by 42 MMT compared to that of 2006–07. Incidentally, the global food crisis of 2007–08 saw India ban its common rice and wheat exports. High MSPs, strangulated private trade and banned international markets forced the government to procure most of the produced grains. The result was FCI’s wheat and rice stocks touching unprecedented level of 82 MMT (against the buffer-stocking norm of 31.9 MMT) on 1 June 2012. Removal of the export ban in September 2011 led to a surge in cereal exports during 2012–13 to 2014–15.
  NHM had an interesting take-off. Starting from a level that was way below the level of foodgrain production in the country, by FY 2016, production of horticulture products at 280 MMT surpassed the grain production at 252 MMT (see Graph 8).

As per the NSSO report on consumer expenditures, consumers’ diets are diversifying from cereals, with increasing consumption of high-value agriculture products such as fruits and vegetables, milk and milk products, fish, meat, and eggs. India is still a largely cereal-eating society, but trends are changing fast with growing incomes. Even in terms of value of production, the share of foodgrains (cereals and pulses) in the total value of output of agriculture and livestock has declined from 32 per cent in TE 1993–94 to 23 per cent in TE 2013–14. The share of fruits and vegetables increased from 14 to 19 per cent, milk from 16 to 20 per cent, and meat from 4 to 6 per cent over the same period.
Comparison with China
Since India aspires to compete with China in terms of economic growth, it may be interesting to briefly touch upon the Chinese experience of reforms, and if there are any lessons for India to learn. It is well known that China started off its economic reforms in 1978, primarily focusing on agriculture. In a three-sector economic pyramid comprising agriculture at the base, industry in the middle, and services at the top end, China’s economic reformers fired the economy from the base, i.e., agriculture. The commune system of landholding was dismantled and replaced with household responsibility system, and much of the agriculture prices were liberated from most stifling controls. This twin attack on existing policies boosted the Chinese agriculture sector, with AGDP growing at 7.1 per cent per annum during 1978–84 compared to just 2.3 per cent during the pre-reforms period of 1952–77. But more interesting was the rise in real rural incomes as a result of farm prices being liberated from various controls. The per capita real rural incomes increased at 15.5 per cent per year during 1978–84. This brought the Chinese poverty levels down from 33 per cent in 1978 to 15 per cent by 1984.This dramatic increase in real per capita rural incomes and decline in poverty served two important purposes: (a) it gave political legitimacy to further carry out the economic reforms with greater rigour; and (b) it created a massive demand for industrial goods, which were being manufactured by Town and Village Enterprises (TVEs), thus paving the way for manufacturing reforms and revolution. It was this home-grown demand from rural areas that was the catalyst for change in the manufacturing sector. China’s services sector picked up momentum much later.
  In contrast, the Indian reforms were more by stealth, and carried out under acute economic crisis. They were basically to stabilize the economy through adjustments in the exchange rate and some trade-policy and industrial delicensing reforms for the industrial sector. They did not focus on agriculture. In fact, agriculture was deliberately kept out of it in the initial phase of the reforms, and later too only piecemeal efforts were made to tinker with agriculture’s policy environment. Since masses in rural areas did not gain much in the initial years of reforms, it lacked the political legitimacy, which was in sharp contrast to the Chinese experience. There was always a lurking fear about the sustainability of the Indian reform process. Nevertheless, the reforms helped the Indian economy to stabilize on the macroeconomic front and to boost its overall rate of growth. But for masses in the rural areas, it was more like a trickle-down approach. As a result, India took eighteen years to halve its poverty—from 45 per cent in 1993 to 22 per cent in 2011 (as per the Tendulkar poverty line), compared to just six years in China. That’s the biggest difference in the nature of reforms carried out by China and India.
  The World Development Report of 2008 (World Bank 2007), after a major survey of the growth experiences of several developing countries over the last twenty-five years or so, pointed out that 1 per cent growth in agriculture is at least two to three times more effective in reducing poverty than the same growth coming from non-agriculture sectors. In the case of China, it was 3.5 times more effective, and in the case of Latin American countries, it was 2.7 times more effective. It is this centrality of agriculture that India needs to realize if it wants to abolish poverty at the fastest rate possible. Given that half of India’s workforce is still engaged in agriculture and almost 75 per cent of poverty is in rural areas, it is not difficult to get this message. And yet, direct and bold reforms in agriculture have remained elusive. Whatever benefit came to agriculture, it came primarily through indirect reforms of the exchange rate and the slashing of import duties on industrial products, and later on, from rising global prices (from 2004–11) and their transmission to Indian agriculture with hiccups and lags. It is high time that reformers in India realized this and adopted a bold agenda for reforming agriculture.
Reforming Indian Agriculture: The Way Forward
Agriculture being a state subject under the Constitution, the central government requires wider consultation with the states for any comprehensive reform package, and that in turn, depends on political will, leadership and time. The 1991 reforms happened in stealth and under acute pressures due to the foreign-exchange crisis; agriculture, however, was never on the reform agenda. The central leadership did not have a champion for the agriculture sector: not surprisingly, the sector limped from one intervention to another, which were only marginal in nature and did not add up to a cohesive reform agenda for the sector.
  There are no doubts about the urgency for reform in India’s farming sector today. However, the strategy of reform will need to subscribe to four larger constraints/objectives. One, the reform process needs to be inclusive of the close to 85 per cent of India’s total farm holdings that are less than 2 hectares. Unless these small and marginal farmers participate in the reform process and diversify their production baskets by moving towards high-value agriculture, the Indian agri sector will not get transformed. Second, unless farming becomes economically and financially viable, the problem of retaining efficient and effective resources, including human resources, will only intensify. Third, in light of the extensive over-exploitation of scarce resources such as water and land, environmental sustainability needs to be incorporated deep into the systems and policies. Fourth, Indian farm products, and thus policies influencing their production, should ensure their global competitiveness. Within these constraints, is it feasible for India’s AGDP to sustainably grow at a rate of more than 4 per cent ? The answer in brief is ‘yes’, provided we are able to carry out at least three sets of reforms as given below:
Getting the Markets Right
We do this primarily by setting right the incentive structures for farmers in terms of getting the best prices for their produce. A five-pronged strategy—liberalize global trade, repeal/reform trade-restricting policies such as APMC and ECA, create mechanisms for risk mitigation and augmentation, deepen and expand the physical (national and global) and financial markets, and invest in agri infrastructures—should set the stage.
  This would amount to opening up exports of all agri commodities, even pulses and edible oils/oilseeds, which are highly restricted today. Also, it would amount to abolishing or drastically pruning ECA, and allowing the private sector to move and store commodities freely across the length and breadth of this country. To check on the fear of ‘hoarding’ by unscrupulous traders, making registration of the stocks—say, above 10,000 MT—compulsory with the National Warehousing Development Authority (NWDA) can do the trick. This can only be a transition mechanism towards freer domestic trade and stocking in the future. Further, imports could be liberalized with moderate duties to ensure that domestic ‘hoarders’ get enough competition through open imports that would keep in check their ‘rent-seeking’ behaviour, if any.
  Further, one needs to reform the APMC Act and allow private mandis to come up in competition with the existing APMC markets. The government should allocate land for that purpose, subject to rationalization of commission fees, mandi taxes and other cess (all combined to be not more than 3 per cent), and allow direct buying by processors and organized retailers from farmer groups (Farmer Producer Organizations). Introducing negotiable warehouse receipt system for farmers, wherein they can get, say, 75 per cent advance against their commodity, and can choose to sell later, would also be of much use to farmers in getting better prices for their produce. Same would be true for forward and futures trading in agri commodities. These institutional reforms (reforming the ‘rules of the game’) towards getting the markets right will go a long way in attracting private-sector investments all along the value chains—modern markets, storages, food processing and organized retailing (including e-commerce)—that are needed so desperately. The private sector can then resolve the issues of grading, assaying, packing, traceability, delivery platforms, etc. Through better prices for their produce, farming will become more remunerative.
Rationalize Food and Agri-input Subsidies and Enhance Investments in Scarce Resources, Mainly Water Management and Agriculture R & D
The overall resources going to food and agriculture sector in India are not meagre. The total input subsidies on fertilizer, power, canal irrigation, and agri credit alone were Rs 1,88,158 crore in FY 2016, while public-sector investments in agriculture were to the tune of Rs 48,757 crore. As a percentage of AGDP, input subsidies amount to about 9 per cent and public investments to about 3 per cent. If one adds to this the food subsidy bill, which in the FY 2017 Budget stands at Rs 1,34,835 crore, and the pending bills of food and fertilizer subsidies that together account for another Rs 1,00,000 crore, the total amount of food, fertilizer, power, canal irrigation, and agri subsidies in FY 2017 would be more than Rs 4,00,000 crore.
  The problem with subsidies is that they lead to very inefficient use of resources, and in the case of food, it leads to large leakages, around 46 per cent in 2011–12. In addition, the food subsidies are also iniquitous, as only the large farmers get larger part of the subsidies because of the sheer size of their holdings. The current thinking on substituting this ineffective, subsidized physical grain distribution system with direct benefit (cash) transfers (DBT) (with an unconditional cash transfer made directly into the bank accounts of the identified beneficiaries) is a step in the right direction. This shift away from a price-policy instrument (PDS) to an income-policy instrument (DBT) will not only make better economic sense but will also help the country achieve its set welfare objective under the original scheme of the NFSA. Calculations show that depending on the nuances of the DBT scheme, the country’s exchequer can save up to Rs 48,657 crore per annum. These savings, when recycled into agriculture as investments—primarily on water augmentation and better management of its use—can transform the sector. This will give a big boost to agri productivity, bring resilience in the system to cope better with droughts and also save on water and fertilizers. Such a reform would be transformational, and has already been recommended by the high-level committee headed by Shanta Kumar set up by the Modi government in 2015 to restructure India’s food management system. The political will is now needed to implement it over the next two to three years.
  In terms of investment on agri R & D, India spends only 0.46–0.7 per cent of AGDP as against the recommended norm of at least 1 per cent for developing countries. This percentage expenditure on agri R & D goes up to 3 per cent in the case of developed countries. However, it is not just the paucity of resources that needs to be blamed, it is also the missing institutional reforms in the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) system that is mandatory for making the whole system transparent and accountable to the scientific community.
Get the Best Technologies within Reach of Farmers
From the Green Revolution of the 1970s, the White Revolution of the late 1970s and 1980s, and the Gene Revolution (cotton) of the late 2000s, the role of agricultural research, technologies and extensions services has been pivotal. If not for the continued agricultural R & D, none of the global and national lab work would have translated into successful and transformative land (agri) stories. Therefore, the importance of access to the best technologies cannot be overstated.
  The Green Revolution came in this country by accessing the HYV seeds of wheat from CIMMYT in Mexico and rice from IRRI in Philippines. The cotton revolution from 2002 onwards occurred by accessing genetically modified seeds from Monsanto–Mahyco. The world is currently moving from green to gene to brown revolution, which emphasizes the role of precision agriculture while taking care of soil and water. Precision agriculture—be it drip irrigation or fertigation, robotics in agriculture, field scripts, drones and doves to monitor agriculture—is the way forward. India cannot afford to remain insulated to these new developments in more advanced countries. Therefore, issues of R & D—in terms of quantum of resources put in, their IPR questions, and how to access from private-sector global companies—will have to be settled for the benefit of millions of farmers and to ensure that Indian agriculture remains globally competitive. The challenge will be in making the technology accessible to small and marginal farmers of India. It could be through an Uber-like model for tractors, harvest combines, or even for drones and doves, to serve the needs of agriculture.
  A forward-looking vision is needed, one that is science based, aligned to market forces, and backed by ample financial resources operating in a global framework. Only such a vision will make Indian agriculture environmentally and socio-economically stable, viable, effective and efficient. A champion who has a vision and has the capacity to persevere to involve states into not just reforming but transforming the Indian agriculture sector will give the needed political legitimacy to the reforms, thereby accelerating agriculture and alleviating the deep-rooted problems of poverty and malnutrition much faster.

Indian Manufacturing Industry: On the Path to Global Leadership
Baba Kalyani
Twenty-five years is a relatively short time in a country’s economic history, but in the quarter century since the reforms, the Indian economy has transformed from being in a state of virtual oblivion to becoming one of the fastest growing in the world. Clearly, this metamorphosis was possible due to the interplay of various factors that broadly include pragmatic government policies, the vision of our entrepreneurs, and a supportive global economic environment.
The Pre-Reforms Picture
Post-Independence India’s economic situation was weak. Foreign-exchange reserves were inadequate and the manufacturing sector was at a very nascent stage of development. The Industrial Policy Resolution (IPR) of 1956 gave primacy to the public sector to create a strong industrial base through which the country could become self-sufficient in various goods and commodities. The role of the private sector was subordinate and essentially required it to support the public sector. This model of development continued through the 1960s, 1970s and a large part of the 1980s. The results were mixed. While on the one hand, the government created an impressive industrial infrastructure in basic industries, on the other, protectionist policies, which did not encourage a free play of market forces, contributed in stifling entrepreneurship and competition. This environment bred all-round complacency and, by the mid-1980s, India had become a high-cost, inefficient and uncompetitive economy.
  The Licence Permit Raj earned India the reputation of being among one of the most difficult countries to do business with. It took Bharat Forge a full seven years from the time it was conceptualized in 1959 to start commercial production in 1966. In the intervening period, we applied for an industrial licence, approval for foreign technical collaboration, and permission to import capital goods. The process of industrial licensing was so stringent that if a company manufactured even a little more than its licensed capacity, it could be penalized and the promoters prosecuted. As a result, there was no incentive to innovate and improve operational efficiencies. The technologies that a company proposed to buy from abroad were strictly scrutinized and entrepreneurs had to justify the need to import. As a precondition to being issued licences, companies had to commit to a five-year phased manufacturing programme, under which the import content in the licensed product had to be gradually reduced. If, for some reason, that did not happen, manufacturing activities could be halted and penalties imposed.
  Travel overseas for business purposes was another challenge. For every visit that we undertook, permission had to be sought from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which would be issued only if we could give a detailed justification for the purpose of the visit, number of days to be spent abroad and the amount of foreign exchange that was needed. There was no fixed time frame within which RBI would issue travel permissions, and I can recall several instances when, although it was important for me to travel, I had to abandon my plans because there was no RBI approval. All this was quite embarrassing to explain to our business partners and associates, leading to the image of our country and entrepreneurs being negatively affected. Discretionary application of rules and procedures reflected a severe trust deficit between the government and the business community, which was perhaps at its peak in those years.
  The plethora of permissions and approvals required at every stage meant that entrepreneurs spent more time in Delhi rather than on managing their businesses. Even for something as simple as hiring an engineer from abroad to erect a piece of equipment required an approval from the Ministry of Industry, which it gave only if we could convince the Director General of Technical Development (DGTD) of the merits of the case. That was not the end of the story. We then had to go to the RBI for permission to buy an air ticket for the engineer to travel to India and pay for his hotel and other living expenses while he was here. The permission was given on the condition that the engineer could travel only with Air India and stay in India for a specified duration, which in normal circumstances was not beyond a month. An extension, if needed, required us to approach the RBI again. This procedure had to be followed on a case-by-case basis. Bharat Forge had a technical collaboration with a US company and, though it had been approved by the government, every visit of a foreign technician from our collaborators still required us to go through the same process.
  The import of equipment, raw material and technology required us to apply to DGTD. To justify the import, we had to ensure that there was no ‘indigenous angle’, which essentially meant ruling out the possibility of sourcing from within the country. An advertisement had to be placed in designated newspapers, to which domestic companies could respond with their offers within three months of the date of publication. The rush was such that newspapers had a waiting list to publish advertisements! Until this time, the import application would not be processed. On completion of the mandatory period, DGTD would evaluate these offers, and it was up to the importing company to justify the need to import. All these complex procedures meant that there was no easy access to essential manufacturing inputs.
  Complex rules and procedures resulted in a poor image of the country among foreign investors. Investments from abroad were negligible and we could not access technologies that could have resulted in a faster and well-balanced economic growth. Several investors in the 1970s and 1980s preferred to set up manufacturing bases in low-cost countries such as Singapore, Thailand, South Korea and Malaysia, in spite of the fact that they had very small domestic markets. The ‘Asian Tigers’, as these countries were collectively termed, became engines for export-led growth. By 1997, when the financial crisis hit these countries, China had already taken major strides in manufacturing, and global investors wasted no time to shift their entire focus to China. Clearly, we were paying the price for our closed-door economic policies.
First Steps in Liberalization
Liberalization in India first began in the mid-1980s and was, to a large extent, restricted to the automotive, technology and communication industries. The first halting steps yielded encouraging results. With the entry of Suzuki Motor company in the Indian automobile manufacturing industry, indigenous component manufacturers for the first time were exposed to Japanese manufacturing processes and practices. This resulted in improved productivity. By nature, I believe, Indians are quick learners. Just when it seemed that the Japanese manufacturers of light commercial vehicles would strengthen their stranglehold on the Indian market, Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland came up with products that were both technologically comparable and competitively priced. Indian component manufacturers did not lag behind and started manufacturing products that were, in some cases, even technologically superior to the imported ones. Gradually, Indian manufacturing industry began to believe that, provided a level playing field, it could compete successfully with the best in the world. Rapid strides made by Indian companies in the information- and communication-technology sectors during that period resulted in improved economic efficiencies. More importantly, the belief that we could develop and manufacture our own products without overwhelming reliance on imports began to gather momentum.
Economic Reforms
The Budget, the New Industrial Policy and Foreign Trade Policy announced in July–August 1991 were landmark reforms in India’s economic history. It was the first step in India’s transformation from a command-and-control based economy to a market-oriented system. Abolition of industrial licensing, abolition of phased-manufacturing programmes (PMP), de-reservation of most industries reserved for the public sector, opening up to foreign technology and foreign investment, abolition of the MRTP Act limits on company size, the two-step devaluation of the rupee, moving a large number of imported equipment from the Restricted list to Open General Licence (OGL), scaling down of the peak rate of customs duty from a staggering 300 per cent to about 100 per cent with a road map to bring it further down to ASEAN levels, and lifting of several foreign-exchange regulations and controls provided a much-needed zest to the Indian manufacturing industry. Importantly, the DGTD was subsequently disbanded. Suddenly, several constraints that had for years crippled our ability to compete had vanished. Many of our companies at first feared that the sudden opening up of the economy would sound their death knell. In reality, what actually happened was quite the opposite. Companies led by visionary entrepreneurs, who were driven by a passion to be truly world class, emerged as significant players in their respective fields. The reputation of Indian companies being unreliable and manufacturers of poor quality goods and services gradually gave way to recognition of our global vision, quality and ability. Since then, India has rapidly risen to become a leader in global information and communication technologies, large segments of manufacturing and a key player in the new knowledge age.
  In the first two decades of the 21st century, several Indian companies through global acquisitions have expanded their manufacturing footprint. What is noteworthy is that infusion of Indian management, technologies and skills resulted in many loss-making companies being turned around and transformed into profitable ventures. These outstanding achievements have created a large number of Indian global business leaders whose intelligence and vision are a source of pride and inspiration for our country. Indian entrepreneurs, managers and technocrats now evoke global recognition, trust and respect.
The Bharat Forge Story
Bharat Forge was set up in the 1960s by my father, Neelkanth Kalyani, who was a first-generation entrepreneur. My father was an agriculturist with no background in industry. He, however, had a vision and, through sheer hard work, self-belief and dedication, set up and steered the company in its initial years. My father believed that strong academics were important for success in any field. From my early years, I had a natural aptitude for science and technology. I was fortunate to get admission into the mechanical engineering stream at the Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, from where I graduated in 1970. Immediately thereafter, I enrolled for an MS at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Boston, US. I then returned to join Bharat Forge in 1972 when the turnover of the company was about Rs 5 crore. Looking back, I believe that my engineering background helped in giving a technology orientation to the business, which is strongly manifest across our company today.
  The country’s economic situation at that time was fragile and the steep devaluation of the rupee in 1969 had made our project almost a non-starter. Nevertheless, we worked hard and gradually built our business. In spite of the severe odds we faced, we never gave up. Instead, we set goals for our company—first, to become the largest forging manufacturer in India, then the largest in Asia and finally, to be the largest and most technologically advanced forging company in the world. Looking back, the adversities we encountered and overcame in our journey over the past fifty years have made us resilient and given us the confidence to take on any challenge.
  The 1970s went into establishing Bharat Forge. The 1980s was a period of consolidation and our phase of growth commenced in the 1990s, corresponding with the launch of India’s economic reforms. Developments in the Indian automotive industry during the 1980s and, notably, the recommendations of the Raja Chelliah Committee on reforms in the country’s indirect tax regime were clear indicators that the economy would be liberalized sooner rather than later. Till then, our focus was entirely on the domestic commercial vehicle market, which was our major customer segment. In 1985, we bagged our first export order from a tractor-manufacturing company in the erstwhile USSR for supply of forged track links. While we successfully executed that order, there was growing realization that if we were to succeed in global markets, it was imperative to invest in modern equipment and technologies.
  When we decided to import two new forging press lines in 1990 from Germany, Bharat Forge’s turnover was about Rs 100 crore, while the cost of the equipment was Rs 150 crore. There are always a few defining moments in a company’s history. For us, the decision to make this investment at a time when the global economy was in turmoil due to the first Gulf War—particularly when we had no visibility with the customers who we would sell our products to—was a watershed. It was a decision that could either make or break the company. Many had termed the investment a ‘white elephant’. However, I was confident that the decision was imperative because that was the only way in which we could secure our company’s long-term future. The fact that our decision was to a large extent based on the confidence that opening up of the Indian economy would lead to new opportunities was vindicated when we started to receive inquiries from customers in different parts of the world. There appeared to be a perceptible difference in the way Indian companies began to be viewed in the international market. While earlier our efforts to make headway with potential customers were generally met with stoic resistance, the opening up of the economy appeared to have broken the ice. We began to be taken a lot more seriously and, perhaps, there was realization that a market as large as ours which was just being opened could no longer be ignored.
  While initially Bharat Forge began supplying products in forged condition, customer trends in the global automotive industry favoured suppliers with capabilities to manufacture higher value-added machined components and aggregates. We therefore invested in high-speed machining lines for crankshafts and front axle beams, which were our thrust products for exports. Gradually, as we established long-term relationships with customers, we became end-to-end service providers. We now have the capability to design, develop, manufacture, test, validate, supply and provide after-sales service to customers. This has enabled us to firmly lock-in with supply chains of virtually every global automotive manufacturer and become their partner in their various vehicle development platforms. Today, Bharat Forge is a supplier to almost every automobile manufacturer in the world; every second, heavy truck (Class 8 and above) manufactured in the US runs on a ‘Made by Bharat Forge, India’ front axle beam; and we are the largest integrated forging company in the world with a global manufacturing footprint. I believe that this would not have been possible if India had remained a closed and protected economy.
  While exporting from India was our first priority, the experience in dealing with global customers led us to believe that they preferred suppliers with dual-shore manufacturing capabilities. This essentially meant that a supplier of critical components was expected to have at least two manufacturing facilities from where he could supply the same product. The reasoning behind this was that any unforeseen eventuality or delay should not disrupt the customers’ supply chain and manufacturing schedule. This reality—combined with our vision to make Bharat Forge a global company—led us to take a strategic decision to establish manufacturing facilities in close proximity to our customers’ manufacturing plants. Rather than set up greenfield projects, which would need considerable time to establish, we decided to take the acquisition route. In 2004, we acquired Carl Dan Peddinghaus, a German forging company, and followed that by acquiring another company in the same group, which specialized in the manufacture of aluminium forgings. Later, we acquired a third company in Germany and then one in Sweden, which was a key supplier to Volvo Motors. Bharat Forge now has eleven global manufacturing facilities—four in India, four in Germany, one each in Sweden, France and United States. About 70 per cent of our total revenues come from sales outside India, which qualifies us as a global company.
  While the commercial vehicle industry has always been Bharat Forge’s main customer, we have, over the years, diversified and developed capabilities to manufacture and supply critical components for the fast-growing passenger-car industry. To reduce our dependence on the automotive industry and to provide a hedge against global economic cycles, we have further diversified into manufacturing products for various non-automotive applications in industries such as aerospace, defence, railways, marine, energy (conventional and non-conventional), oil and gas, mining, and construction equipment. Our facilities at Pune, Baramati and Satara are inherently versatile to cater to customer requirements in all these sectors.
Make in India: A Transformational Initiative
The 1990s and the early part of the 21st century saw a phenomenal rise of the IT and IT-enabled industry. Low costs, availability of skilled manpower and our demographic dividend contributed in creating competitive advantage for India in this industry. A large number of our young workforce was drawn to the IT sector and, globally, India became a hub for development of high-quality software. Developments in the IT industry coupled with growth in the financial and other service-oriented sectors resulted in the share of services in national GDP increasing to about 60 per cent. The growth in services, though welcome, had an impact on manufacturing, which was no longer able to attract the kind of talent that was needed, particularly for critical areas of research and innovation. Importantly, the perception about manufacturing as not being ‘fashionable’ began to grow.
  The global economic and financial crisis of 2008 was a setback for the world economy as well as for Indian companies. It took us about five to six years of concerted hard work and perseverance to recover. Even during this testing period, Indian companies performed relatively better than their global counterparts. What the manufacturing industry in the country required was recognition to bring it on centre stage as a key driver of economic growth. This push came when Narendra Modi took over as prime minister of India in 2014.
  Within weeks of assuming office, Modi launched his ‘Make in India’ initiative. In spite of the rapid strides made globally by our manufacturing companies and even though skills, capabilities, capacities and technologies were indigenously available to manufacture a large range of products within the country, we were importing about 75 per cent of our defence requirements. In the capital-goods sector, our dependence on imports is close to 45 per cent and even in the automotive industry we source over 40 per cent of components from abroad. Taking advantage of our country’s liberal import policies, several foreign companies had begun to dump their products into India at unfair prices. The rise in imports is clearly not to the advantage of Indian manufacturing industry as well as for job creation within the country. The emphasis of the government’s ‘Make in India’ programme will progressively result in a marked reduction in reliance on imports in defence production, aerospace, railways, capital goods and other critical infrastructure sectors. Clearly, the trend is shifting towards indigenization and import substitution but with a difference. Our focus is now not just the domestic market as it was in the past but to become a significant player in the global market.
  To facilitate ‘Make in India’, the government has also initiated measures to improve the ease of doing business. In Maharashtra, for example, the number of approvals to start a new venture have been reduced from seventy-five to twenty-five. With competition among states to attract investments gathering steam, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, West Bengal, Odisha, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh and several others have taken steps to lay out a red carpet for investors. However, this is an area where a lot more still needs to be done.
Skilling India
The ‘Skill India’ campaign is another noteworthy initiative that will help us leverage our demographic advantage. I see ‘Skill India’ as an enabler to empower people so that they can contribute effectively to growth and development. Empowering youth and making them key stakeholders in development is a key challenge for our country. More than 75 per cent of our population is less than thirty-five years old. Many of these young people are technically qualified and are willing to work hard. On their shoulders rest the hopes and aspirations of an entire country. We need to build on this strength and make a ‘Skilled India’, which would be a source of sustainable competitive advantage. In the manufacturing industry, one of our key advantages is ‘frugal engineering’, which Carlos Ghosn, CEO of Renault, aptly summarized as follows: ‘There is a thirst for learning in this country that allows an Indian engineer to innovate and create a product frugally as compared to engineers in other parts of the world who need significantly more resources to do the same thing.’
  I believe that this is a clear indication that India is being perceived as an embryo for R & D and technology development in the world. High-quality entrepreneurship coupled with the strength of our ‘brain power’ and ‘skills of innovation’ will make India one of the three largest economies of the world by 2030, with lesser dependence on foreign technologies and more reliance on domestically manufactured goods and services.
  I am confident that ‘Make in India’ will help attract significant investments from India and abroad into the manufacturing industry. If India is to realize its potential as a leading global economy, the share of manufacturing in GDP will need to increase from the present 16 per cent to 25 per cent in the next five to seven years. This would also help create a 100 million additional jobs in the country, which is an equally important priority. While doing this, we also need to take adequate steps to ensure that the technologies that we use are environment friendly.
  Corporate India has to play a key role and partner with the government for the success of ‘Make in India’. Several of our companies have taken various initiatives, particularly in the area of developing technical skills and capabilities. At Bharat Forge, we have created a talent pipeline through which we work closely with engineering colleges, particularly in the rural areas. Under this initiative, we help institutes design their course curricula so that it is relevant to the needs of modern industry. We also invite faculty from these institutes to our company and conduct workshops and training sessions to provide them with a better understanding of technological developments that are taking place in industry. Finally, we recruit a fairly large number of students from these institutes and induct them into our workforce.
  Bharat Forge has taken over three Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) at Khed, Bhor and Malegaon in Maharashtra besides having set up our own ‘Centre of Excellence’ at Khed. We have created new infrastructure and introduced courses that would be useful to imbibe students with skills required by modern industries. We also conduct vocational training courses at these ITIs to equip people with non-technical skills and capabilities.
  Our group’s in-house training activities are conducted at the state-of-the-art facilities set up at the ‘Kalyani Centre for Technology and Innovation’. We run structured in-house training programmes for our employees aimed at enhancing their skills and competencies. We have tied up with leading academic institutions from India and abroad to deliver these programmes. They include BITS, Pilani; University of Pune; Defence Institute of Advanced Technology, Pune; IIT Bombay; University of Warwick, UK; and Deakin University, Australia. We are confident that these initiatives will help empower people and contribute in creating a base of high-quality technically qualified knowledge resource in the country.
The Way Forward
Indian manufacturing industry is at the cusp of a great opportunity. Manufacturing growth in China has slowed considerably. Recent geopolitical developments, including fears of growing protectionism among the large trading nations, has resulted in global investors evincing renewed interest in India, a consumption-driven economy. Our government has also seized the initiative and, in a series of measures, has reformed the country’s foreign-investment policy to allow higher levels of investment from abroad in diverse sectors, including railways, defence, civil aviation, pharmaceuticals and single brand retail. As a result, India has become one of the most open economies in the world. I would, however, like to exercise a word of caution. While Indian industry welcomes competition, government must ensure a level playing field for domestic companies and fully safeguard our interests.
  There are many factors that are working in favour of manufacturing in India. We have a stable government committed to economic reforms, our economy is sound and among the fastest growing in the world, our institutions are robust, we have a large and growing domestic market, there are high-quality entrepreneurial and professional capabilities available in our country, and we have a strong demographic advantage supported by an educational infrastructure that will provide an assured pipeline of trained manpower for years to come. We now need to leverage these advantages to create a competitive and cost-effective manufacturing ecosystem, through which we can make the country self-reliant and an exporter of a range of manufactured products. To achieve this, there are a few enablers that we need to put in place and some challenges that we must prepare to deal with.
  At the macro level, there have been several successes that can be attributed to the twenty-five years of economic reforms in India. To my mind, the notable among these are:
* A clear consensus among political parties about the benefits of economic reforms. Domestic and global investors are, therefore, confident that economic reforms in India will inevitably continue, notwithstanding which political party is in power.
* Narrowing of the trust deficit between government and industry. Greater openness in interactions between the government and industry has given confidence to both sides.
* Transparency in government procurement procedures in key sectors such as aerospace, defence and railways, which until recently were in the government’s exclusive domain but have now been opened for private-sector participation. Policies and procedures are for the first time being prepared in consultation with all stakeholders. My only suggestion is that implementation of policies should be fast tracked so that the country is able to achieve a higher level of self-reliance within the shortest possible time.
There are also certain areas in which we need to place greater emphasis in order to draw maximum advantage:
* The ‘ease of doing business’ is an area where a lot has been done in the past two years, but there is still scope to do even more. While the government of India has initiated several measures, we need to see more traction at state-government levels where most industrial approvals and permissions are actually issued.
* State governments need to play a more proactive role in industrial development. One of the key areas in the domain of state governments is labour, which has been an issue of serious concern for entrepreneurs from India and abroad. I am glad that some state governments have begun taking steps to reform their labour laws, which have otherwise remained static for decades. I believe that strong political will is necessary to modernize labour legislation in the country to bring it at par with competing countries. While this is a challenge, it is also an imperative for sustainable competitive advantage of the Indian manufacturing industry.
* State governments also need to be made stakeholders in the country’s exports. Mechanisms need to be put in place through which state governments facilitate exports, particularly at a time when Indian exports are facing severe headwinds in international markets.
* With India emerging as a major global manufacturing and export power, we need to aggressively leverage the successes of Indian companies to build brand equity. ‘Make in India’ must become a symbol for precision quality, credible reliability, outstanding innovation capabilities, a conscientious protection of the environment, and a benchmark for customer care and service. Government and industry will need to work together to create Brand India.
* Recent trends in manufacturing speak about the onset of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. It has been explained as a ‘technological revolution that will fundamentally alter the way we live, work and relate to one another’. It involves fusion of technologies in the physical, digital and biological worlds. The speed of change that it will bring will disrupt almost every industry. In the automobile industry, driverless cars could become the disruptor, threatening the employment of millions of people. On the other hand, because of technology, people may not need to step out of their homes, making travelling itself redundant. As a country, we will need to keep a close watch on developments such as these. We will need to prepare, adapt and embrace new and emerging technologies that could reshape the very way in which we live.
* While keeping pace with technology, we will also need to create a manufacturing ecosystem, in which our companies can grow, flourish and prosper. For this, the need is for a hassle-free environment in which policies and procedures are well documented and are administered without discretion. The manufacturing industry must be the key driver of growth in the Indian economy because it is only through growth in manufacturing that we’ll be able to create employment opportunities for our young population.
While the government’s role is to facilitate investments and create conditions for industrialization, the onus is clearly on the private sector to provide the momentum for growth. In the twenty-five years since reforms, we have seen a significantly changed mindset among Indian entrepreneurs. No longer do they need protection from the government to shield them against competition. There are several instances of Indian companies having competed successfully against their global counterparts, both in the domestic and international markets. TCS and Infosys rank alongside global giants in terms of software capabilities; Tata Motors is now a name to contend with in the global automobile industry; and Reliance is among the top ten global producers for most of its major products and is widely regarded as one of the most competitive and profitable petrochemical companies globally. These successes have given us immense confidence. We now need to leverage the strengths that we have developed to scale up to the next level, in which we build unassailable, long-term competitive advantage. One of the key factors is the need to closely monitor market and technology trends in our businesses and respond by aligning them with customer expectations and requirements. We must also continuously emphasize on developing new sources of competitive advantage in areas including finance, materials and manpower. The days of being satisfied with making incremental changes to our businesses models are behind us. We now need to develop new mindsets that will allow us to make radical changes in our business models, should these be required to capture opportunities.
  The Indian manufacturing industry has the inherent strength to rise to any challenge. It has done so in the past, will do so in the future and is poised to create a niche for itself on the global stage. I take great pride when I see the Indian tricolour fluttering at the entrance to Bharat Forge’s manufacturing facilities abroad. I look forward to the day when we will be able to see our flag flying in the skies of many more factories in different parts of the world. I am confident that the path we have chosen will result in immense progress and prosperity for our country in the years to come.

Political Economy of Petroleum Sector Deregulation
Vikram Singh Mehta
India must create an efficient, profitable, competitive and sustainable petroleum sector. This sector does not lend itself to a surgical fix. It cannot be systemically overhauled in one fell swoop. Change can be brought about through step-by-step incremental measures: good can be done even if the best is not within reach.
Introduction
On 24 July 1991, Finance Minister Manmohan Singh unshackled the Indian economy from ‘Licence Raj’ and ushered in reforms that wove together the forces of globalization, liberalization and technology. He quoted Victor Hugo’s ‘nothing can hold back an idea whose time has come’ to herald this relatively radical shift. I say ‘relatively radical’ because the government had no choice but to take the turn it did. The country was on the edge of a financial crisis and the Fabian ‘command-and-control’ foundations on which economic policy was grounded had recognizably corroded. The FM’s pronouncement focused on the macroeconomy but the ‘idea’ permeated every interstice of the economy. In particular, it triggered conversations within the Ministry of Petroleum on the steps required to liberalize the oil and gas sector and create a world-class and competitive petroleum industry.
  In 1991, the petroleum sector was arguably the most heavily regulated sector of the Indian economy. Every aspect of the value chain—from exploration and production, refining and distribution, sales and marketing and pricing and margins—was controlled directly or indirectly by the central government. The petroleum companies and their management were run as appendages of the Ministry of Petroleum. This state of affairs was the result of an early decision by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to place the petroleum industry under the custodianship of the State. He deemed the energy sector and, in particular, Petroleum to be strategic and in occupation of the ‘commanding height’ of the Indian economy. He did not believe the private sector could be entrusted to deliver the corresponding public interest.
  This Nehruvian view was given formal expression in the industrial policy resolution of 1956, which reserved petroleum for the public sector. This policy created two 100 per cent government-owned public enterprises, viz. Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) for exploration and production of oil and gas, and Indian Oil Company (IOC) for refining and marketing petroleum products. The government determined that these two companies would be the corporate vehicles through which it would develop the petroleum industry. The incumbent private companies, Burmah Shell, Exxon and Caltex, were informed they would be allowed to continue but their operations would be circumscribed and limits placed on the remittance of profits to their parent company. Their assets were nationalized in 1976 but from 1956 onwards, these three companies operated under the shadow of this notice.
  This article is a story of the steps taken to undo a forty-year-old legacy of ‘command-and-control’ and the results and consequences of these initiatives. It is a story of the conflicting pressures that the Indian government faced when, on the one hand, they looked to the discipline of the market to harness India’s hydrocarbon potential, and on the other, sought administrative control to meet political and social objectives. It is a story which offers useful pointers to the difficulties of finding a pathway between the autonomy of the free market and the fetters of public-interest–driven regulation.
Background
As already noted, the petroleum industry was run as an extension of the Ministry of Petroleum almost from the time of Independence. The Ministry of Petroleum approved the exploration programme despite the technical complexities; it determined the production plans and capital outlays for refineries; appointed the distributors and dealers; and decided the market shares for each company. Moreover, it set the prices and margins for each of the main consumption products (viz. LPG, kerosene, diesel and gasoline) through an ‘oil pool’ account that was managed via a complex linear programming exercise. The formula assured the PSEs a fixed 12 per cent (marketing companies) to 15 per cent (exploration companies) post-tax return on capital employed.
  Thirty years of this ‘command-and-control’, closed system created an industry that was inefficient and corrupt. There had been some successes, like the discovery of the offshore Mumbai High field in the early 1970s, but these were exceptions. The underlying reality was underperformance across the value chain. The production of oil and gas (for example, Mumbai High) was declining; the refineries were suffering from scale diseconomies and high operational costs; there was a widening mismatch between indigenous supplies and domestic demand, leading to shortages of essentials; the distribution, pipeline and storage infrastructure was shoddy, compounding leakages, imbalances and black marketing; the dealers were incentivized to spike kerosene into diesel because of the differential in the price of diesel and kerosene created by the subsidy regime which led, in turn, to fuel adulteration and air pollution, and there was no concept of customer service. The industry was, in short, ripe for reform.
  These internal shortcomings were compounded by a tightening international oil market. The price of crude had increased sharply over the previous two decades and with it the pressure on the balance of payments. To mitigate matters, the government had, in the early 1980s, relaxed its policy on oil exploration. They had allowed private companies to enter the upstream sector on the basis of a production-sharing contract. The company bore 100 per cent of the exploration risk but in the event of a commercial discovery, it received a predetermined share of the production. The terms were competitive but the areas offered to the private sector were not perceived by the international companies to be geologically attractive. The response to this initiative was consequently patchy and in the end it did nothing to arrest the widening demand–supply gap.
  So, in the 1990s and as the balance-of-payments situation worsened and the petroleum industry sank deeper into a financial and operational mire, the government was compelled to ask: ‘What must be done to create a world-class and competitive petroleum industry? Should the government withdraw from the role of arbiter of petroleum policy? What role should the private sector play? And how can the State meet its commitment to provide clean, reliable and affordable fuel without choking the dynamics of the market and/or jeopardizing the macroeconomic balance?
  The story of petroleum sector reform is in effect a story of how the government sought answers to these questions—the initiatives that it took in response and the contrarian forces that surfaced as a result.
Deregulation Initiatives
Three initiatives were taken by the Ministry of Petroleum during the 1990s to answer the above questions.
  The first and perhaps most far-reaching was the establishment on 18 January 1995 of the ‘Strategic Planning Group’ (hitherto referred to as the ‘R’—reforms—Group) under the chairmanship of Dr Vijay Kelkar, the then secretary, Ministry of Petroleum. The group had a broad-based composition. Its members included the chairmen of the major private petroleum companies (viz. Reliance, Shell, Essar, Aditya Birla Group), the CEOs of financial institutions (ICICI); consultants (McKinsey, BCG), academics, and the chairmen of PSEs (ONGC, IOC, etc.). The mandate of the group was to recommend the steps required to create a world-class and competitive petroleum industry.
  The R Group submitted its report to the Inder Gujral government in 1997. It recommended that the industry be fully deregulated but in phases and over a four-year period. Specifically, it stated that the government should abolish the ‘cost plus’ administrative pricing system and replace it with a market-based system; that it reduce and rationalize the subsidy regime relating to kerosene, LPG, diesel and petrol; and that it unshackle PSEs from bureaucratic control and grant its managers operational and financial freedom. Cognizant, however, of the power of the ‘status quoist’ economic and political interest groups, the report further recommended that the process be gradual and targeted towards a ‘soft landing’. It stated that in the first year, deregulation be limited to only those segments and transactions that did not tread on political turf. It identified these to be refining and the pricing of intermediate products like bitumen, paraffin wax and naphtha, and suggested that the private sector be permitted to invest in refining and the retail price of these intermediate products aligned to the market. It recommended that the government defer the liberalization of the other more sensitive activities and transactions such as retailing of transportation fuels; market pricing for petrol and diesel; reduction of subsidies on LPG and kerosene; as well as financial and managerial autonomy for the PSEs from the second year onwards and thereafter. Its end objective was total deregulation by the end of the fourth year.
  These recommendations were approved by the Gujral government in November 1997 and subsequently by the Vajpayee government. A gazette notification was accordingly issued on 1 April 1998 that the petroleum industry would be fully deregulated by 1 April 2002.
  The second initiative followed close on the heels of the approval of the R Group report. This was the decision to disinvest the government’s shareholding in the refining and marketing companies HPCL (Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited) and IBP (Indo-Burmah Petroleum).
  As already noted, the private marketing companies Exxon, Burmah Shell and Caltex had been nationalized in the mid ’70s. The assets of Burmah Shell were transferred to Bharat Petroleum (BPCL) and that of Exxon and Caltex to HPCL. These two companies had grown significantly since and by the mid-1990s, they controlled approximately 45 per cent of the refining and marketing market. The balance 55 per cent was controlled by IOC (45 per cent) and IBP, formerly a British JV with approximately 1000 retail outlets predominantly in the Northeast. The government’s decision to disinvest its majority stake in HPCL and IBP and to consequently relax its control over these companies therefore heralded a major structural change in the market and a radical departure from past practice. It also signalled the government’s intent to create a transparent, market-oriented and competitive ecosystem.
  The third initiative was to lay out the conditions for private-sector eligibility for market transportation fuels under the company’s brand. This initiative was a logical fallout of the R Group report and the decision to disinvest. It was also a reflection of the government’s concern regarding the rising opportunity cost of India’s inadequate logistical and distribution infrastructure. Two examples brought this cost into sharp relief. One, the severe shortage of LPG and the consequential growth of a black market for the product. A part of the reason for this shortage was that India had only two LPG import terminals in the country, in Mumbai and Visakhapatnam. It could not therefore import sufficient quantities to satisfy the latent demand. Two, the rising costs of demurrage. It was estimated that IOC spent over $100 million annually on demurrage because of the inadequacy of deep-water ports for crude oil tankers.
  To contain these avoidable losses, the government leveraged the appeal of India’s large market to attract private-sector investment into production and infrastructure activities. It issued a directive that only those companies that had invested Rs 2000 core in one or more of the following businesses would be eligible for a marketing licence to retail petrol, diesel, kerosene and LPG, viz. exploration and production of oil and gas; refining; LNG regasification terminals; and pipelines and petroleum storage facilities. Such companies would be allowed to operate unencumbered; they would be free to set prices and brand their outlets. And most importantly, they would operate on the same level field as the incumbent public-sector marketing companies.
  These three initiatives triggered considerable activity. A number of companies dusted off their India investment plans. Three companies—Essar, Reliance and Shell—met the Rs 2000-crore condition and received a marketing licence. Caltex and SHV built LPG import terminals. Total Oil invested with HPCL in an LPG storage cavern. And BP and Shell expressed interest in the deep-water prospects offshore of the Krishna–Godavari basin.
Deregulation Dilemmas
One concern, however, overhung the deregulation process. The strength of the political commitment. How strong was this commitment? Would the politicians abort the process in the face of altered market and political circumstances? There were good reasons for this concern. For, petroleum-related issues sit at the nub of every politician’s deepest dilemmas. They have to reconcile efficiency with equity. Efficiency requires the creation of competitive and market-oriented systems. Equity demands that the public be protected against high prices through regulatory checks. They have to balance industrial growth with environmental protection. Petroleum products are the engine of industrial development, but they are also major contributors to air pollution and global warming. They have to crack the conundrum of the relationship between the State and the Market. The former are the custodians of public interest. The latter drives efficiency and innovation.
  Industry was cognizant of this political reality. They knew that in the context of India with its legacy of forty years of Fabian socialism, the residual ideological antipathy towards the market, the pressures of incumbent vested interests and the state of the macroeconomy, politicians would have to show huge resolve to stave off the pressures to ‘roll back’ deregulation. In the end, their concern was justified. Politicians did not show such resolve and slowly but inexorably they stalled and then reversed the deregulation process.
Deregulation Unravelled
The first casualty of populist politics was the disinvestment of IBP and HPCL. Both these companies had been listed for disinvestment. The government had announced that it would sell down their shareholding—totally in the case of IBP and partially for HPCL—but they did no such thing.
  The IBP disinvestment was rolled back subtly and behind closed doors. This was because the process had already begun and the government did not want to draw undue attention to its change of heart, especially since it had received praise for the clarity and transparency of its approach. Every company had received full data; they had been given sufficient time to carry out due diligence, and to all intents and purposes, the bidders, whether Indian or foreign, private or state-owned, were being given an equal and fair chance to acquire the company. What prompted the ‘change of heart’ is not known as the bid process was completed and the company was acquired by the highest bidder, IOC. The fact that there was a change of heart is however clear given that IOC bid an irrationally high price. It was more than twice the offer made by the second-highest bidder and it made no economic or commercial sense. The only explanation for such a bid had to be the government’s determination to keep IBP within the public sector fold. Rumours did, of course, abound to explain the bid. The explanation accepted by most people was that politicians were concerned they would be criticized for allowing a formerly British-owned company to fall back into the hands of an MNC. There was also concern at the security implications given that the bulk of IBP’s retail outlets were located in the Northeast. Whatever the truth, all that the process achieved was that the IBP lost its independent standing and came under the control of IOC. It remained however firmly within the fold of the public sector.
  The HPCL disinvestment did not require any subterfuge. The government aborted the process before the companies started their due diligence. They pegged this decision on the legal argument that HPCL had been created by an Act of Parliament and as such, its ownership could only be altered through a superseding new Act. Here again, the government did not provide more than a legal explanation for its decision. But the general view was that the politicians were concerned that disinvestment would trigger labour unrest and that this could lead to fuel shortages in the run-up to the 2004 General Elections.
  The second casualty was the R Group report.
  As already noted, the government had through the gazette notification of 1 April 1998, deregulated the petroleum sector on 1 April 2002. As a consequence, the public sector companies were designated ‘Maharatnas’ and given broad-based operational and financial autonomy. Over the next two years between April 2002 and July 2004, they exercised this autonomy to alter the price of diesel and petrol twenty-three times (fifteen times upwards and eight times downwards). Further, Reliance and Essar invested in refineries and in time these two companies created in Jamnagar one of the largest refinery hubs in the world. Finally, the private sector entered main fuels retailing. Reliance, Essar and Shell acquired permission to set up over 5000 retail outlets and although everyone knew that it would be years before they posed a threat to the monopoly of the public sector, the writing of private sector competition was now firmly on the wall.
  Much of this movement towards a free and competitive market went into reverse gear in 2004 following the election to power of the UPA coalition led by the Congress. This was a fragile coalition and as regards petroleum-sector deregulation many of the constituent members thought market economics would not make for good politics. Their views were reinforced by the tightening of the international oil market. The price of crude oil in April 2002 when the gazette notification was issued was around $26 per barrel. A few months into the new government in 2004, the price had risen to $40 for a barrel.
  The decision to reimpose price controls over the PSEs in July 2004 did not therefore come as a surprise. It was in keeping with the rhetoric and the ideological leanings of the senior members of the UPA Cabinet. The gazette notification of April 2002 was not revoked and the de jure status of deregulation was not altered. Instead, the government used its administrative and ownership clout to ‘revoke’ the operational and commercial autonomy of the PSEs. Pricing decisions were brought back de facto into the hands of the Ministry of Petroleum.
  The reimposition of administrative pricing had broad-based negative consequences.
  First, it pushed the marketing PSEs (IOC, BPCL, HPCL) off the financial edge. This was because these companies were now compelled to retail LPG, kerosene and diesel below the cost of production. The consequent loss was huge. It is estimated that IOC, BPCL and HPCL lost (‘under-recovered’) approximately Rs 3,00,000 crore over the five-year period of 2005–2009. In FY 2011–12, they ‘under-recovered’ an additional Rs 1,33,000 crore. These losses were ‘nominally’ covered through long-dated IOUs issued by the government but there was a cash drain. These triple A-rated companies consequently ended up with amongst the most leveraged balance sheets of any PSE (for example, approximately Rs 1,40,000 crore in 2009). The upstream company ONGC was also badly impacted. For, it was required to assign almost 50 per cent of its earnings to keep the downstream companies financially afloat. As a result, it was compelled to cut back its exploration expenditure and reduce its R & D budget.
  Second, it killed market competition. The private-sector marketing companies could not compete against the administrative price structure of the PSEs and had to effectively close down their marketing operations. Essar and Reliance shut their retail outlets; Shell kept them open but lost the bulk of its diesel volumes. The private sector was also pushed out of the LPG market. Shell sold its LPG import terminal in Pipavav and exited the business; SHV and Caltex stopped operations.
  Third, it called into question India’s commitment to creating a competitive, fair and open operating environment. Many petroleum companies took India off their agenda and there was a general downgrade of interest in investing in India even amongst the non-energy–related MNCs.
Conclusion
With the benefit of hindsight, one wonders whether the government would have been better equipped to balance ‘good economics’ with ‘good politics’ had they imposed deregulation through one surgical strike and not followed the prescription of the R Group to deregulate in phases and incrementally. One should also ask whether the government should not have made a greater effort to harness the ‘soft power’ of public opinion before embarking on the politically sensitive subject of petroleum sector deregulation.
  In my view, the government did well to look for a ‘soft landing’ rather than go for a surgically swift implementation of deregulation. First, the political system does not allow for radical overhaul. The antibodies to such a shift are much too powerful. Second, incrementalism provides the time and space for the multiple stakeholders to align behind each step in the process. Third, once the first step is taken, it is easier to move forward with larger subsequent steps. Four prime ministers (Gujral, Vajpayee, Rao and Modi) supported petroleum deregulation. They were able to do so because they followed the footsteps already taken by their predecessors. And finally, incrementalism changes the discourse of deregulation. Whatever the short-term twists and turns on deregulation, there is no gainsaying the fact that the R Group report led to the inclusion of the subject of petroleum deregulation in the government’s vocabulary. It is because of this fact that when the market conditions changed in 2014, the Modi government was able to bring deregulation back on to its policy agenda. Today, with relatively low oil prices and a strong central government, deregulation has been almost fully effected. The prices of all petroleum products are determined by the market; the subsidy on kerosene and LPG has been reduced and the private sector is looking once again to invest.
  As regards the ‘soft power’ of public opinion, this has often been deployed by countries to help strike the right balance between the Market and the State and to manage the political dilemmas. This is because in an electoral democracy, public opinion is the politician’s lodestar. When that shifts, the politicians move in synch. Many countries have used this power to effect change. Malaysia, for instance, expended much effort to explain to its public the benefits of a market-driven pricing structure. They explained that subsidies took away funds from essential infrastructural investments to the longer term detriment of public welfare. Their efforts paid off and they were successful in effecting their deregulation programme. The Indian government should have made a similar effort to educate the public on the costs and consequences of subsidies and regulation on the macroeconomy and social (education, health) and physical (roads, ports, housing, water) infrastructure investment. They should have tested the assumption that consumers are loath to give up the benefits of subsidies even though the bulk of subsidies are sequestered by the middle man and the corrupt, and does not reach the intended beneficiary. They should have researched the question: ‘Might the consumer prefer a small and phased increase in the price of essential fuels in return for the assurance of secure, affordable and quality fuel supplies?’ In the absence of such an effort to ascertain the views of the public, the government went with the conventional wisdom that consumers will not accept short-term pain in return for possible long-term gain. In the absence of effort to secure public support for ‘good economics’, they followed blithely the path laid out by what they believed was ‘good politics’ and brought the deregulation process to a standstill.
  Petroleum engages multiple stakeholders: the politician who knows what should be done but does not know how to get re-elected thereafter; the government that appreciates the importance of fiscal prudence but does not have the legislative backing to stave off political pressure; the bureaucrat who will espouse the virtues of the free market but is loath to relinquish the power and patronage derived from control over a cash-rich industry; the management of the PSEs which want operational and financial autonomy but dare not ignore the demands of their government bosses; and the consumer who wants reliable, clean and affordable energy but does not object when the government pegs the logic for ‘bad economics’ on its perception that the consumers desire nothing but subsidies and low prices. The story of the petroleum sector reform over the past twenty-five years has been all about managing these interwoven and often conflicting interests. The storyline that emerges from this review of the twists and turns of deregulation is fuzzy but two hard truths do emerge
  One, the market is remorseless. It cannot be indefinitely bucked. This said, the market does not offer a panacea. It has to be fettered. The challenge for governments, now and into the future, is to find the appropriate balance between a functioning market and regulatory oversight.
  Two, petroleum engages public and private interest. It will not go off the political radar; and consumers will never be totally indifferent to its evolution. Its future concerns everyone. The government must endeavour therefore to engage all stakeholders as they push to create a world-class, competitive, entrepreneurially innovative and sustainable petroleum sector.

India Evolving: Infrastructure since 1991
Jessica Seddon, N.K. Singh
The country’s infrastructure may be perpetually described as ‘straining’ under the pressures of economic growth and transformation, but the quarter century has seen a remarkable expansion of its scale and reach. At the same time, the transition path has been a learning process. The transition is also still under way and must accelerate— ‘recalibration’ must not slip back into ‘naïve optimism’.
India’s 2016 infrastructure looks substantially different from what it was in 1991. First, there is more of it, in more places. Five million Indians had telephones in 1991. There are more than a billion telecom subscribers, mostly wireless, in India in 2016.1 The proportion of India’s population with direct access to real-time information and communications networks has increased dramatically over the past quarter century (see Figure 1a). Access to electricity has also grown over the years. Just over 50 per cent of the population reported an electricity connection in 1990; close to 80 per cent did so by the 2011 census (see Figure 1b). Although access to actual electrons flowing through wires is lower—just 67 per cent of households report use of electricity for lighting in the 2011 census—nearly all (97.6 per cent) of villages are grid connected.2 The road network has expanded and evolved to include more state and national highways, while the number of rail network-kilometres has also grown (see Figure 1c, 1d). In 1991, air travel was rare and almost entirely provided by the state-owned airline. India has one of the world’s largest and fastest-growing domestic civil aviation industries as of 2016, with increasing numbers of links not only between the major metros but also to emerging regional hubs. The 2016 Civil Aviation Policy includes a provision for developing 350 new ‘no frills’ airports in more remote areas. Urban and, particularly, rural access to clean drinking water and sanitation has increased3 (see Figures 1e, 1f). Similar expansion and improvement have occurred in other sectors, from ports to public transport; irrigation to fuel pipelines. The country’s infrastructure may be perpetually described as ‘straining’ under the pressures of economic growth and transformation, but the quarter century has seen a remarkable expansion of its scale and reach.

  More significantly, the production process for infrastructure has changed. Infrastructure in 1991 was largely financed, developed and maintained by the public sector. Electricity, where it was available, came from state-owned power plants and publicly constructed dams, and was conveyed over transmission and distribution lines owned and managed by state-government-owned utilities. Telephones—‘landlines’—were instruments at the end of wires owned and operated by the Department of Telecommunications. The transport network—roads, rails, ports, inland waterways—was almost exclusively constructed and maintained by public-sector entities, as were many of the freight- and passenger-transport vehicles that used them. Water infrastructure—drinking water supply, irrigation, removal and treatment of wastewater—was done through public-infrastructure projects servicing a limited subset of India’s urban and agricultural territory.
  Infrastructure in the present times, enabled by new technologies and incentivized to meet new needs, involves a mix of public initiatives, private ventures and public–private partnerships (PPPs) as providers. Although distribution remains largely in public hands, nearly 40 per cent of grid-connected and captive power is generated from plants with substantial private investment. The proportion of private participation in renewable energy, which some would argue is the energy of the future, is more than twice that figure.4 Drinking water has seen a similar shift to a marketplace of options: in urban areas, borewells and private tankers filled with groundwater complement and compete with piped water. India’s largest desalination plant, at Minjur in Tamil Nadu, was built by IVRCL Infrastructures and Projects Limited, along with the Spanish multinational Abengoa—a distinct change from the era of large public-infrastructure projects as ‘temples of modern India’.
  Similarly, India’s increase in teledensity was substantially driven by the mobile-phone industry, an almost entirely private endeavour (albeit built on access to spectrum, a public resource). The balance-of-capital requirement has shifted from a network that required substantial public investment and limited household investment (in the fixed line instrument) to an arrangement where consumers are essentially financing a large part of the system through their payments to private providers as well as to the Universal Service Obligation (USO) fund for extending communications networks to rural areas. This is a significant departure from the days of the Department of Telecommunications, Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited (MTNL) and Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited (VSNL).

In transport, much of the network infrastructure remains publicly owned and operated, but private companies have an increasing role in construction, operation and maintenance of the urban and internationally connected parts of the network in particular. Just under 60 per cent of India’s air traffic flows through airports that have been built and operated by private developers5 and a quarter of the highway-kilometres have been constructed and/or managed by the private sector.6 Minor (state-level) ports, which tend to have a higher proportion of private involvement than the major (national) ports, handle 44 per cent of the maritime trade.7 More than half—57 per cent—of freight is now being carried by privately owned road freight fleets rather than on the publicly owned Indian Railways tracks.8
  The transition from limited, publicly provided infrastructure in 1991 to more expansive access and higher-quality infrastructure delivered through a diverse set of institutional arrangements has been a significant shift. Much of what we take for granted today as the nature of infrastructure development would have been unthinkable in 1991.
  At the same time, the transition path has been a learning process. This essay argues that India’s infrastructure development since 1991 can be divided into three broad eras: ‘naïve optimism’ during the initial opening of markets and investment opportunities to the private sector; ‘realization’ years in which policymakers recognized that the state had to change in order to attract significant private investment towards public goals on sustainable terms; and the more recent ‘recalibration’ involving a renewal and reshaping of India’s public–private interface in infrastructure. The next section lays out this evolution from opening, to high-level-policy reframing, to implementation of new public–private relationships. It draws on examples from the three sectors that have seen the most sustained change in the public–private mix of investment: electricity, transport and telecommunications.
  The transition is still under way and must accelerate: ‘recalibration’ must not slip back into ‘naïve optimism’. In physical terms, there are still major gaps in India’s infrastructure: congested ports, lack of even one deep-sea port, and connections to inland logistics; limited last-kilometre connectivity for roads and for true international-standard broadband; at least a third of the country with inadequate access to electricity and clean energy for cooking and heating; urban infrastructure that is far behind the needs of larger cities, much less smaller and fast-growing ones. These gaps are also opportunities for India to ‘leapfrog’ conventional, and now obviously unsustainable, infrastructure systems. Seizing this opportunity, however, will require the deepening and acceleration of the transformation of the public–private relationship that has been under way since 1991. The Rs 3.96 lakh crore (4 trillion, or about 18 per cent of the Budget) of public funds allocated to infrastructure in the 2017–18 Budget must be accompanied by the acceleration of regulatory and policy changes to attract at least as much private financial and technological contributions.
  The third section concludes with some thoughts on the context for such a ‘leapfrog’, given the larger context of technological, economic and political developments that have both affected the normative roles of public and private sector in infrastructure development and altered each group’s ability to deliver the kind of infrastructure that India requires.
India’s Infrastructure Evolution: Three Phases
India’s engagement with the private sector in infrastructure provision in each sector has gone through three broad phases: naïve optimism immediately after liberalization; realization of challenges in combining market forces and public purpose; and recalibration to make the institutional changes required to support constructive co-evolution. The specific time frame for these phases varies by sector (see Table 1), but each sector’s development has passed through roughly the same evolution in approach.
Naïve Optimism
The first phase of liberalization focused primarily on attracting private investment and participation in infrastructure alongside public initiatives in order to fill the gaps in infrastructure faster. The then finance minister Manmohan Singh’s Budget speech in 1993, for example, noted:
Industrial modernization, and especially the creation of internationally competitive industries, requires a massive expansion of and qualitative improvement in infrastructure . . . Traditionally, these areas have been the preserve of the public sector. Substantial expansion of public investment in these areas is certainly necessary. However, the needs of the country are far beyond the capacity of the public sector to deliver in a reasonable time frame. The government has, therefore, adopted a policy of encouraging private-sector involvement and participation in these areas to supplement the efforts being made by the public sector.
This initial era of infrastructure policy reforms comprised stroke-of-the-pen reforms to open up new sets of activities to private companies and private finance, without as much thought to why these companies would actually undertake these activities, what terms would be sufficient to attract them, or how to shape pursuit of profit towards contributions to public purpose. The 1996 India Infrastructure Report submitted by Expert Group on Commercialization of Infrastructure Projects (chaired by Rakesh Mohan)9 provided the intellectual rationale for much greater private participation in Indian infrastructure, but it also offered several notes of caution—that public-sector investment would be a critical backbone for sustaining growth; that growth prospects were a precondition for attracting private investment; and that institutional, legal, financial and regulatory reforms would be essential for facilitating the free flow of investment into infrastructure. The early years of policy opening, however, belied more naïve optimism.
 
  Table 1: Phases
 
  In electricity, for example, the central government opened electricity generation to private participation in October 1991. By August 1995, there were 189 projects planned, offering over 75,000 MW of capacity and investment of more than Rs 2,76,000 crore ($67 million in 1995 dollars).10 The red carpet was laid out, from an international ‘road show’ of high-level secretaries from the power and finance ministries in May–June of 1992, to openness, to negotiated (rather than competitively bid) memoranda of understanding11 and designation of ‘fast-track’ projects with sovereign repayment guarantees of 16 per cent rate of return on capital. In and of themselves, these projects would have met only a small part of the new generation capacity required, even if they had all been implemented (which did not happen),12 but the hope at the time was that they would serve as ‘showcases’ to catalyse further investment in the sector.13
  Enron’s Dabhol plant on the Malabar coast was one of the most visible symbols of this era: a relatively advanced ‘new fuel’ (naphtha/gas) plant, built to supply a sole customer (the Maharashtra State Electricity Board) that many observers were not sure could either use or pay for the power, with extensive guarantees from the state and Union government. The negotiations on the terms were secret, the Foreign Investment Promotion Board rejected its proposal for guarantees, and the World Bank refused to finance the project. Industry commentary and advocates called it a ‘watershed’. The gamble may have paid off if fuel prices (which were passed through to the customer) had not unexpectedly increased, if power trading to widen the customer base had been allowed and enabled earlier, if both parties had had incentives to manage risks and adapt, or if its parent company, Enron, had not otherwise run into turmoil. As it stands, however, the best thing said about the project is that ‘it helped government policy evolve’.14
  There was much less attention to restructuring the public part of the electricity system in the early years. The distribution sector, the main customer for electricity, remained in public hands, with almost no attention to even middle-ground steps such as ‘corporatization’, which would shift these bodies to more commercial operation and clearer accounting for subsidies.
  In transport, restrictions on private participation in transport were steadily repealed from the mid-1990s to the 2000s, but mostly in areas where the public-sector presence was limited or new needs were emerging to be met. Civil aviation in India was almost completely controlled by the government after the Air Corporations Act of 1953 nationalized the existing airlines and created Air India (international) and Indian Airlines (domestic). The Act was repealed in 1994, and the number of flights expanded dramatically. India’s central government ports had been owned and operated by port trusts under the Union Ministry of Shipping. Through a series of policy guidelines as well as amendment of the Port Trust Act in 1996 and 1997, the government began to allow private operators to construct terminals, provide services, and enter into joint ventures with the national port trusts. There has been reluctance to move towards the full ‘landlord’ model15 of private operation in public facilities. However, the services model remains in force. Port trusts remain operators as well as landlords, with this structure giving rise to inherent conflicts of interest. The invitation to the private sector was further extended to foreign investors in 1998, with a shift to automatic approval of up to 100 per cent FDI in ports and shipping, and 51 per cent in support services. Some state governments moved further than national policy. Minor or state-owned ports were more aggressive in courting private investment in the 1990s and in even allowing captive ports. Mundra, India’s largest private-sector port, for example, began with the 1994 approval for a captive jetty from the Gujarat Maritime Board.
  The private sector may have been invited to open spaces in the transport system, but there was much less change in the structure of the public-sector incumbents involved in transport at this point. Railways remained protected. Provisions for private investment in inland container depots (albeit with some relatively onerous conditions for land acquisition attached) were passed only in 2005. While corporatization, or restructuring of public-sector service providers to function along commercial lines at arm’s length from political control, has proceeded at the state and urban levels with experiments such as the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation,16 national discussions have been slower. India’s nationalized airlines have been consolidated into one but the move to operate on commercial—if not private—lines has been euphemistically termed a ‘marathon’ as of 2017.17 Indian Railways, the vertically integrated behemoth, continues to remain firmly in government-department mode in spite of a series of specific restructuring recommendations from the 2001 Indian Railways Report18 and the 2014 India Transport Report19 of the National Transport Development Policy Committee also chaired by Rakesh Mohan, to the 2015 Report of the Committee for Mobilization of Resources for Major Railway Projects and Restructuring of Railway Ministry and Railway Board chaired by Bibek Debroy. Among the actors in Indian infrastructure, Indian Railways have perhaps been the most resistant to reform, while continuously losing traffic, both freight and passengers, to other modes, particularly roads. With the exception of the 2017 Budget (the largest ever for Indian Railways), the annual investment in the railways has been about half that in roads since the mid-2000s.
  The initial years of telecommunication liberalization, like in power and transport, involved opening the doors to private participation without substantially changing the core network infrastructure or its governing framework. Telecoms equipment manufacturing was opened for private participation in 1991, in part to develop technology to be deployed through public initiatives. In principle, the National Telecoms Policy of 1994 opened up the telecom sector for competition in basic and value-added services. In practice, however, the policy left the public-sector incumbent (at that time the Department of Telecom and MTNL) in charge of many critical functions as well as the backbone network, conditions that significantly affected operating conditions for private licensees.
  As in other sectors, the private sector did take the invitation. Various companies, including leading corporate groups such as Tatas and Reliance, along with new entrants such as Himachal Futuristic Communications Ltd, bid for and received licences for basic and cellular services, and radio paging. The first auctions were for wealthier, more densely populated—hence more viable—urban areas, but licences for other circles with lower population density were also bid for and awarded.20 Online services were also opened for free entry to private companies in 1998, and 110 licences were awarded to Internet service providers within the first couple of years.21
  Many of the bids, however, turned out to be wildly optimistic and operators did not actually make the investments required to use the spectrum that had been allocated. Some also requested delayed or reduced payment for the licences. While some of the optimism may have stemmed from a misreading of the market, the public sector’s dominant position as regulator, policymaker and competitor also limited business potential. The government also retained policymaking and tariff-setting authority until 1997, when the Telecoms Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) was established by court order, and the public-sector utilities retained dominance over critical pieces of the network. There were no provisions for interconnection, for example, or termination of telephony.22 Though the private ISPs were allowed to lease transmission links from basic telecom providers, the international traffic was still controlled by DoT’s Internet node or Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited’s Gateway Internet Access Service. VSNL also had a monopoly over international Internet-leased lines as well as the terms for private access to these parts of the network.
  India’s limited focus on opening up infrastructure opportunities for private participation, without comprehensive attention to restructuring the larger systems, may have been a function of policy bandwidth and prioritization in the early 1990s. ‘Infrastructure problems were not the central focus of policy when the reforms began in mid-1991,’ notes Montek Singh Ahluwalia in his review of the infrastructure policy in India. ‘The agenda for reforms in the early years was understandably dominated by crisis management and the need for domestic and external stabilization.’23
Realization Years
The ‘realization’ phase involved both an intensification of efforts to attract private investment and recognition that more intensive change in the policy and regulatory context for private investment would be required. Tactics in this era of infrastructure initiatives reflect several broad lessons from the early years. First, that safeguards needed to be put in place to ensure that agreements between public and private sectors were more transparent, competitive and equitable in allocating risks between public and private parties. Second, that regulatory independence and capacity would be key for managing a marketplace of public and private infrastructure providers in the public interest as well as for rationalizing the balance between user fees and subsidies that would inevitably still be required. Third, public-sector capacity for setting the terms of PPPs was limited and would need to be built. Much of today’s high-level policy framework for infrastructure was laid during the realization period; implementation of the new approach is still under way as part of the ‘recalibration’.
  The language of infrastructure policy began to shift from a focus on investment to a more nuanced target of ‘bottlenecks’ during the realization phase. ‘The next ten years will be India’s decade of development. To achieve this objective our strategy must encompass the following elements . . . [including] a sustained assault on infrastructure bottlenecks in power, roads, ports, telecom, railways and airways,’ noted the then finance minister Yashwant Sinha in the Budget speech of 2000–01. By the end of the decade, the euphemisms had been dropped: ‘Investment in infrastructure for the growth of economy is critical. I have urged my colleagues in the central and state governments to remove policy, regulatory and institutional bottlenecks for speedy implementation of infrastructure projects. I, on my part, will ensure that sufficient funds are made available for this sector,’ offered the then finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, in the Budget Speech of 2009–10.
  The ‘realization’ years of electricity-sector reform, for example, looked past generation capacity to focus on redefining policy and regulation as well as reining in cross-subsidies and power ‘lost’ to non-paying customers to create a market-linked ‘pull’ for private investment. Federal diplomacy came first in the late 1990s, with the prime minister convening a conference of chief ministers in 1996 and again in 2001 to develop and refine a Common Minimum National Action Plan (CMNAP) for power. Both meetings explicitly focused on metering and reduction of cross-subsidies as well as more explicit accounting for subsidies in state budgets rather than as obligations buried in SEB accounts. Enabling legislation came next, with the Electricity Regulatory Commissions Act of 1998 and the landmark Electricity Act of 2003. The 1998 Act created the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission and made it easier for private companies to sue state governments to demand formation of a regulatory commission.24 The Electricity Act of 2003 laid out a vision and enabling provisions for a competitive electricity market, in which generators would compete to provide power at the lowest cost; the transmission grid would reliably carry any seller’s output to meet demand across the country; and distribution utilities would provide electricity and customer service to metered, paying customers. Further amendments to the Act in 2014 deepened the emphasis on competition by separating carriage (wires) from content (power generation) in the distribution sector and encouraging multiple-supply licensees.
  Financial incentives for restructuring were the third prong of the ‘realization’ era in electricity. The government formed an Expert Group in 2001 to recommend measures for a one-time settlement of SEB arrears and suggest strategies for capital restructuring to improve these entities’ credit ratings. Following the report’s recommendations, the government approved a one-time settlement of the SEBs’ outstanding dues in March 2002.25 The national government also launched the Power Development and Reform Programme, initially designed to provide investment support for states to upgrade their distribution networks to reduce technical losses, but later expanded to include incentives for states to reduce their overall losses (due to theft and/or technical losses). The Accelerated Power Development and Reforms Programme (APDRP) of 2002 was followed by the Restructured APDRP (R-APDRP) in 2008, and subsumed under the Integrated Power Development Scheme in 2013. The 2015 Ujwal DISCOM Assistance Yojana (UDAY) programme, which encourages states to accelerate reforms as well as take over and refinance SEB debt in exchange for access to additional central funding for power-sector development, could be seen as the latest iteration of incentives to restructure the distribution sector. Like its predecessors, however, it only addresses the stock problem—the accumulated debt. Stemming the flow, or accumulation of losses will require a shift in state governments’ mindset. Competitive federalism and increasingly obvious economic damage from intermittent power supply and expensive backup may press some states to reform tariff policies; competitive politics may drive others to continue to cross-subsidize for as long as possible.
  The competitive market envisioned in the 2003 Act and 2014 amendments has been slow to materialize, however. States have been slow to unbundle, and open-access provisions that would allow electricity generators to connect directly with consumers other than distribution utilities remain incompletely implemented. Pricing, metering and collection efficiency have been slow to change, and distribution-sector finances remain precarious, leaving those who would invest in new generation capacity with limited market incentives. Transmission-grid infrastructure and management protocols—the critical ‘distribution channels’—from generation to distribution, also need to be strengthened before the Electricity Act of 2003’s vision of a free-wheeling marketplace, open to new technologies, can be realized.
  Similarly, in spite of a steady drumbeat of exhortations to address consumer pricing for electricity, there has been little progress on rationalizing power tariffs and limiting cross-subsidies. The original expectation that the setting up of ‘independent’ State Electricity Commissions along with the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission would lead to rational tariff, setting it free from political influences, has clearly been belied. The 2004 Task Force on the National Electricity Policy (chaired by N.K. Singh) emphasized the importance of untangling cross-subsidies and increasing user charges, as did the resulting NEP. The 2014 Amendment to the Electricity Act also reiterated mandatory metering and revised sections sixty-one and sixty-two on tariff-setting to mandate recovery of ‘all prudent costs’, ‘without any revenue deficit’. The 2016 Economic Survey called for regulators to simplify pricing, apply welfare analysis to setting rates and cross-subsidies, and match industries in need of power with excess generating capacity in need of a buyer by allowing open access. ‘[Tariff restructuring] is easier said than done,’ noted Pramod Deo, former chairman of the Central Electricity Regulatory Committee, in response. ‘It is a political issue and a systematic problem.’26
  The realization era in transport primarily revolved around developing an institutional framework to harness the PPP model for use in highways, airports, and to a lesser extent, in container operations in railways. The Central Road Fund, a non-lapsable corpus financed by a cess on petrol and high-speed diesel, was also a key institutional innovation for accessing lower-cost private finance for roads development. The 2000 Ordinance-cum-Act created a pool of funds for use in specified road and rail development and maintenance, as well as an asset against which the government could raise finance for the national highways programme. This innovation has not been as widely applied to other sectors as it could be. The USO Fund for extension of telecommunications service to remote areas, for example, would likely achieve its purpose faster if it were converted into a similar structure rather than kept as a pool of funds for BSNL to use for extension of service.
  Although the move to PPPs occurred across various infrastructure sectors, it was most prominently promoted in transport. The roads sector took the lead, promoting PPPs as an integral part of the National Highways Development Programme (NHDP), but more ambitious projects such as Hyderabad and Mumbai metros (at the time some of the highest-value transport projects in the world) soon followed suit.27 In terms of quantity and value, transport projects accounted for the bulk of India’s foray into PPPs over the 2000s (see Figure 2).

  The policy promotion of PPPs worked on three tracks for the first wave of partnerships.28 The initial approach to developing PPPs in India across sectors was to create and showcase pilot PPP projects as a ‘proof of concept’. Many of the initial PPP attempts, with the exception of those undertaken by the NHAI were stand-alone, ad hoc, champion-led projects. Second, policy focused on shoring up project finances to ensure that they would be attractive for private investors. The government announced viability-gap funding29 for PPPs in 2005, followed by India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited in 2006 to provide long-term financing for projects. Third, the government attempted to build capacity for project design by developing a set of ‘Model Concession Agreements’ (MCA) for use by various agencies and state governments.30 It also established the India Infrastructure Project Development Fund (IIPDF) in 2013 to support consultants, transactions advisers, and other costs associated with project design.31
  The MCA approach made sense as an initial approach to quickly build capacity in a public sector that was more used to direct construction (sometimes with procurement) than articulating project structure, risks and responsibilities for an external partner. In retrospect, however, it has several limitations. First, any weaknesses in the contract design are propagated across a large number of projects. Second, a ready and accepted model creates less incentive to scrutinize the details of the projects to ensure that the agreement includes reasonable cost estimates and risk allocation. Third, many projects of interest have unique technological, input or demand risks that may go beyond standardized templates. There have been calls for revision of the model concession agreements across sectors, particularly as banks’ exposure to non-performing assets in infrastructure have mounted. An August 2016 submission from the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Transport, for example, pointed out that the National Highways Authority of India had allowed concession agreements with cost estimates different from those used in loan applications to go through. It suggested that the revised MCA, including various provisions for project exit and clarifications on responsibilities, be reviewed by banks and financial institutions as well as ministries.
  Throughout this period, much of the dialogue around PPPs focused on their ability to attract private finance into infrastructure, rather than their ability to bring in new technologies, management practices, complementary risk mitigation or other benefits from the partnership. The then finance minister Chidambaram described the PPP imperative as ‘a need to adopt a more aggressive approach for preparing a shelf of bankable projects that can be offered for competitive bidding’, in his 2007 Budget speech, for example. This is actually one of the weaker reasons to enter into PPPs, since public-sector access to finance is nearly always cheaper than private. Private borrowing also creates long-term economic liabilities that may be difficult to justify, since the efficiencies gained through the partnership do not reduce the overall financing required relative to public finance and implementation.32 Reform attention is also focused on contract design, rather than the management of the longer-term relationship. Both approaches have recently been reviewed and revised as discussed below in the recalibration section.
  In telecommunications, the 1999 National Telecommunications Policy, the TRAI Amendment Act 2000, the Unified Access Licensing regime first proposed by TRAI in 2003, and, importantly, a revision in the terms of licensee payments, helped the sector turn a corner from the limited, fragile, private participation of the late 1990s. The 1999 NTP and 2000 Amendment started to clarify the division of regulatory responsibilities from adjudication and dispute resolution by setting up the Telecoms Dispute Settlement Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) for the latter. It reiterated that TRAI was meant to be an independent regulator and clarified its legal precedence over the Department of Telecommunications. NTP 1999 also committed to separating the Department of Telecommunication’s service provision role from policymaking and licensing, removing (at least in principle) its conflict of interest as both competitor and policymaker.
  Many observers, however, identify two changes in the licensing regime as the critical turning point for the sector. First, the shift from a fixed licence fee to revenue sharing in the 1999 NTP allowed existing licence holders and their financiers a reprieve. While some in the government at the time argued that the shift offered an unnecessary concession to companies that had bid, agreed to pay and should pay, others felt that the cost of this lesson would damage the sector irretrievably. The latter camp prevailed. Second, unified licensing—provision of service for an area using any technology—is seen as a catalyst for telecommunications-sector growth in an era of changing technology. The new regime, developed in part through consultation with industry,33 opened the door for innovative technology selection rather than simply arbitrage between approaches to different ways of providing the same service.
  As the sector grew, however, and the telecommunications market and its revenue potential expanded, these high-level changes in the framework did not provide sufficient protection for safeguarding public value in public–private collaboration. The ‘2G Scam’, in which the government offered a second round of licences on the same ‘first-come, first-served’ basis as 2003 rather than auctioning them, brought corruption into the headlines, with sensational estimates of revenues lost to the public. The headlines focused on the crores of rupees, while the legal wrangling in the background hinged on justifying the ‘first-come, first-served’ for a market that was increasingly attractive. Pradeep Baijal, one of those accused of being responsible for the ‘first-come, first-served’ approach used in 2008, writes an insider’s view of the differences between the policy requirements of 2003 and 2008, as well as the way in which these differences were recognized by key stakeholders such as the finance ministry.34 His narrative highlights the fact that while some policymakers did recognize the need to move from an approach suitable for a new market to one more appropriate for 2008, the process was not strong enough to ensure that regulatory advice prevailed over political pressure to dispense favours.
  In summary, the realization years ended with many of the high-level frameworks for public–private coexistence in place or at least on the radar as important policy problems. None have been fully implemented; all need further refinement to shepherd not only today’s public–private interaction towards delivering better infrastructure, but also the unforeseen challenges and opportunities that new technologies will bring.
Recalibration
The ‘recalibration’ phase under way now (and overlapping with continued ‘realization’) is distinguished by the growing recognition that public and private sectors must interact, collaborate over time, and jointly address technology and economic surprises in the infrastructure context. This requires not only accelerating the development of disinterested technical expertise such as urban planning, technology evaluation, regulatory review and other conventional elements of state capacity, but also institutionalizing the balance between flexibility and policy consistency, coherence and specialization, and discretion with accountability.35 It also requires a shift in focus to systems rather than simple dividing lines between public and private roles at a project level. Part of this realization has been forced by the prospects of private competition for public infrastructure providers; but other aspects of the new approach seem to have grown out of the increasing visibility of ‘last kilometre’ hurdles in infrastructure as well as the fragility of the first-generation PPPs and private investments.
  There are three broad categories where recalibration of the public–private relationship is both important and, to some extent, under way: (i) reframing PPPs to look at the context for longer-run interactions rather than simply the initial contracts; (ii) rationalizing and clarifying accounting so that it’s clearer about fund flows, opportunities to improve fiscal sustainability and incentives to provide infrastructure services efficiently; and (iii) continuing to develop the institutional framework for balancing accountability with independent expertise.
  The effort to restart stalled PPPs (and infrastructure projects in general) began in 2012 with the formation of a special group within the Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, to review stalled projects and fast-track clearances. The initiative was in some ways the epitome of realization—taking the time to identify a mix of regulatory hurdles, financing constraints, challenges in environmental and other clearances from national and state entities, and land-acquisition problems.
  Recalibration, however, requires systemic approaches rather than project-by-project disentangling. The investigation found two broad classes of challenges. First, PPPs that foundered due to mistaken assumptions (e.g. lower traffic, more challenging building conditions) combined with the pressures created by the relatively short-time horizon for available finance. Second, projects that stumbled on land acquisition, either ex ante in terms of obtaining the necessary permissions, or ex post being criticized as unnecessary ‘giveaways’ to the private sector. These challenges interact, to the extent that conditions for the project change, and renegotiation becomes desirable. Any change that benefits the private sector has the potential to attract criticism. ‘The problem lies in an ostrich-like belief that once negotiated, ground conditions will continue to hold forever; that the terms of the agreement between the private party and the state are cast in stone; and that any changes required can only attract charges of crony capitalism,’ noted Vinayak Chatterjee, chairman of Feedback Infrastructure Services, in 2011 during a review of India’s PPP experience.36
  The Kelkar Committee recommendations focus on the partnership part and proposed a framework for ‘a change in attitude and in the mindset of all authorities dealing with PPPs, including public agencies partnering with the private sector, government departments supervising PPPs, and auditing and legislative institutions providing oversight of PPPs’.37 It is still too early to assess the implementation of the committee’s recommendations, and much will depend on actual implementation of critical functions such as faster dispute resolution. The Amendment Bill to the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, proposed in this year’s Budget speech is an important step. According to the finance minister, it will ‘streamline institutional arrangements for resolution of disputes in infrastructure-related construction contracts, PPP and public utility contracts’.38 (Just as in the critical turning point for telecommunications in the late 1990s, there is a need to untangle the past—the stranded assets in roads and power in particular and the financial stakes locked in these—as well as build a new course for the future. It will be important to move from ongoing discussions about creating one or more ‘Bad Banks’ to address India’s non-performing assets in infrastructure and beyond to credible implementation. This is an area in which the ‘balancing act’ state capacities of flexibility and discretion will be essential.
  However, general developments in infrastructure finance echo a constructive shift in attention to governance and financial course-correction over the life of the project rather than the moment of contract as a simple summary. The Reserve Bank of India, for example, issued guidelines for the establishment of Infrastructure Debt Funds to provide a secondary market for infrastructure assets and thus an opportunity to restructure risk and bring in longer-term finance for infrastructure—as Non-Banking Financial Companies in 2011. It revised them to allow more exposure to operational projects in 2015.39
  Pricing and accounting reform has started to gather momentum, but it’s still a mixed bag. Both are important for several reasons: first, improving fiscal sustainability through direct recovery of costs from those who can pay; second, clearly distinguishing between losses due to social obligations versus those from inefficiencies; and third, avoiding disincentives to stall on reforms that would affect the flow of cross-subsidies.
  The electricity sector continues to be entangled in cross-subsidies from commercial to agriculture and household loads, and SEB accounts are often opaque. Although the legal basis for an open-access regime is in place, tariff regime creates a strong disincentive to allow paying customers, from residential developments to industrial areas, to leave the system by contracting with alternative providers (using the SEB infrastructure as a distribution channel). It also creates a disincentive for supporting the paying customers’ own generation of distributed renewables by purchasing excess power via a feed-in tariff. Some state electricity boards in fact do the opposite, continuing to levy a cross-subsidy surcharge on larger electricity users who rely on their own installed capacity rather than connect to the grid at all.
  This financial tangle also distracts from the larger problem of market redesign to accommodate new and intermittent renewable sources of power. An increasing amount of wind and solar generation capacity is coming online, at lower and lower rates that affect the viability of investment in non-intermittent sources or storage required to continuously meet the load requirements. Electricity markets will have to adapt on several levels—from ‘time of day’ consumer tariffs, to reshape the load profile, to fees for grid stability services rather than just electricity inputs.
  The transport sector has seen limited moves towards more visible accounting, to distinguish clearly between public provision of resources for social obligations versus otherwise operating with commercial efficiency. Contrary to the repeated recommendations for corporatizing the railways, the Rail Budget was merged with the general Budget in 2017. While the minister had mentioned that this would allow for more explicit accounting for the costs of public-sector benefits given through free or subsidized rail access, critics have noted that the move towards a merged budget actually makes the railways accounts more opaque, with corresponding reduction in accountability. Furthermore, it has allowed Indian Railways to sidestep older and more urgent reform suggestions to adopt commercial accounting. On pricing, the ministry has not yet implemented the setting up of a rail-tariff authority, and did not address the persistent freight cross-subsidies to passenger rail in the 2016 Budget. However, the railways did take an unprecedented step of implementing ‘surge pricing’ on some express trains in September 2016. Similarly, Indian Airlines ran its first operational profit in 2015–16, since its creation in 2007. It still carries substantial debt even after a 2012 bailout, but it is being held to the tight performance targets, and recent demands for a softer budget constraint have not been met.40
  Within regulation, India appears to be developing an intertwined mixture of regulators, technical oversight bodies, and judicial and non-judicial dispute-resolution bodies. This is a departure from the first wave of conventional wisdom on the importance of independent, arm’s-length regulators staffed by experts and walled off from politics and political decisions. However, Dubash and Morgan argue that this kind of ‘regulatory governance’ may be a more reasonable approach to guiding public and private contributions to infrastructure in settings with ‘highly salient transnational pressures on the state; comparatively intense redistributive politics; and limited state capacity’.41
  The evolution of dispute resolution from the realization to recalibration periods is particularly striking. The first round of regulatory bodies set up in the 1990s and early 2000s combined oversight with dispute resolution in one entity. The Telecoms Regulatory Authority of India was an exception when the 1999 National Telecommunications Policy carved TDSAT from the regulator as a separate sector-specific entity. Disputes still spilled over into the courts, however, across infrastructure sectors.42 In an effort to relieve some of the backlog of cases around infrastructure among other sectors, the government has opened up the potential for arbitration with the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015. The Kelkar Committee also recommends an Infrastructure PPP Adjudication Tribunal to focus on this category of disputes.
  The success of broad-based regulatory governance, however, will depend on the progress of capacity building within and outside regulators, technical wings of ministries, committees in Parliament, and the dispute resolution entities themselves. There are a variety of structural barriers to capacity development. First, the general scarcity of ‘independent expertise’ in the relevant sectors—as is common around the world. Many of those who would have the technical understanding required for policy, regulation and dispute resolution come from the industry themselves and thus may be seen as having vested interests. A clear regime for managing the revolving door needs to be developed. Second, the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) that is often looked to staff many parts of the regulatory governance infrastructure are brought in through an entrance exam and frequently rotated through assignments in a way that selects and reinforces highly skilled generalists. As a result, India relies extensively on consultants, which, in turn, affects data management, organizational learning, and incentives for experts to transfer knowledge to their colleagues and employees.
Looking Ahead: Recalibration in an Evolving Context
  ‘What we learn to do, we learn by doing.’
—Aristotle
Nichomachean Ethics
Infrastructure is important for growth, ease of doing business, ability to attract investment, social inclusion, and creation of employment and opportunities—everything that India seeks to accomplish in the coming years. Yet, it is also contingent upon continuing the overhaul of public institutions, private marketplace norms, and the relationship between the public and private sectors that began in 1991. The country’s ability to extend access to the high-quality infrastructure that it will need for environmentally and socially sustainable development over the coming decades is deeply intertwined with the institutional environment. India has moved from a setting in which public and private roles coexist to one in which they are more likely to co-evolve with direct influence on each other.43 Co-evolution, briefly, can be described as a context in which there are distinct forces driving the evolution (selection, variation, replication) of initiatives in various arenas—public, private, community or cultural spheres—but these evolutionary processes are intertwined. Political dynamics driving public-sector initiatives, for example, also affect competition among private providers of infrastructure.
  There are three developments that will shape India’s continued ‘recalibration’ in bringing public and private sectors together for infrastructure development. First, the boundaries on growth strategies are changing. Increasingly visible environmental change means that fossil-fuel intensive growth may be too costly, not only for the world (the externality), but for India itself. Rising levels of air and water pollution are visible and consequential reminders of local effects of ‘growth now, environment later’ tactics. Given that infrastructure substantially shapes our ability to maximize socio-economic development for a given level of resources, we will have to be strategic in how the next round of investments are made. Moreover, the shift from the use of human intellectual capital to information technology, algorithms and artificial intelligence has implications for infrastructure development. We will have to think about how to optimize information flow as well as goods flow to ensure a level and distribution of employment that meets the needs of India’s young population. The precedents of evolution from agriculture to manufacturing and services, and their implications for infrastructure, may no longer be relevant guidance.
  Second, the technologies for infrastructure are changing in ways that generate new opportunities for businesses as well as public-sector agencies to sustainably meet consumer needs. Changes in the scale and cost structures for providing data, energy, clean water, and other services affect the normative roles for public and private sectors as well as the actual opportunities for both to meet visible needs. The resulting combination of technologies can have a number of impacts. On the one hand, private entrants seeking to meet paying customers’ needs may relieve the pressure on the public sector to develop infrastructure—tanker water, for example, reduces the urgency of piped networks. The private value of infrastructure has increased enough in some cases to justify private investment in proprietary infrastructure, instead of just waiting, e.g. captive ports, captive power.
  On the other hand, technology change can affect the economics of infrastructure investments by allowing people to opt out of public provisions. The possibility of obtaining water from a borewell, for example, places a cap on user charges that can be viable. Looking ahead, it is possible that the state electricity boards could be simply bypassed if private entities are able to both generate and store power economically.
  Third, the distribution of power within the public sector is shifting. India has become both substantially more federal, but also more centralized and coordinated. India has decentralized in economic and political terms since 1991, and the constituent units have started to be more openly competitive for investment, in political claims of successful development, etc. This has added to the fragmentation of authority and jurisdiction, and has also changed the objective function for infrastructure. Infrastructure projects are now justified as much in terms of economic competitiveness as development impact.
  ‘Learning from states’ is also important as a new approach to federal management. India’s Constitution gives the central government substantial fiscal power and some extreme political powers, but states are increasingly politically powerful and less likely to conform to national governments’ requests or laws simply because the rules have been stated. The central government has used a variety of financial incentives, intergovernmental diplomacy, and other tactics to motivate state reforms. The latest tactics appear to focus on how the national government can reinforce states’ own constituency-, competition-, or leadership-led efforts to reform. This approach has its benefits—allowing creativity, innovation and diverse approaches in a varied country—but it also adds a layer of fragmentation for efforts to develop nationally integrated networks.
  In summary, a state that is itself in transformation must at the same time develop new capacities for partnership with the private sector and citizens, even as these two groups are discovering and responding to new social and economic pressures. The economy and the expectations of its participants are not sitting still while the state decides how to invest in infrastructure that shapes India’s transformation.

Infrastructure: Hopefully a Renewed Opportunity for the Private Sector
Vinayak Chatterjee
For all the problems we face today, Indian infrastructure has taken huge strides forward in a broad range of sectors through new introduction of the private sector in what was earlier a public-sector preserve. But we have made mistakes in seeing the private sector as mainly a way to bring scarce capital into infrastructure, however with little regard to putting in place enabling institutions, laws and processes which could put that capital to effective use.
It is difficult to look at the current state of Indian infrastructure and not be pessimistic. The big infrastructure boom that was triggered in the late 1990s, and reached its peak about five years ago, appears to have reached its end. Many of India’s largest private-sector infrastructure developers—who, during the boom years of the last decade, executed a massive expansion of India’s road network, set up new power plants, helped modernize India’s creaking port infrastructure and built world-class airports—face the very real possibility of going bust. India’s public-sector banks, which helped fund that boom, now face the risk that a large share of their loans made to infrastructure may never be paid back. India’s citizens, who have been promised for years that we, as a country, would get infrastructure on par with that of China’s, continue to struggle with power cuts, crowded and unsanitary railway stations, erratic water supply and gridlocked roads.
  The subjective experiences of the commuter and citizen are more than borne out by official statistics. Investment in the economy as a whole, which was growing at 24 per cent in the last quarter of 2009–10, had, by the last quarter of 2013–14, actually shrunk as compared with a year earlier. Indeed, as of the fourth quarter of 2015–16, investment growth remained weak, having fallen by just under 2 per cent from a year earlier.1
  As a share of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), fixed investment was 30 per cent in the third quarter of 2015–16, compared with over 36 per cent in as late as the second quarter of 2011–12. According to the Economic Survey, as of December 2014, the stock of stalled projects (of which infrastructure was a substantial part), stood at Rs 8.8 lakh crore, or 7 per cent of GDP.2 This has led to a vicious cycle—as the writers of the survey pointed out—as work on projects comes to a halt and cost-and-time overruns add to the financial problems faced by the developers. This makes them even less willing to commit to future investment, exacerbating the slowdown in the sector.
  Yet, it is precisely at this moment of gloom that it is important to take a step back. For all the problems we face today, Indian infrastructure has taken huge strides forward in a broad range of sectors such as roads, ports, power supply, civil aviation infrastructure (e.g. airports) and urban infrastructure. Whether it is the Delhi metro rail project; the Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru or Hyderabad airports; or the investment in roads that led to an increase in the surfaced road length of 58 per cent between 2001 and 2011, even the sector’s severest critics will admit that we are nowhere as bad as we were at the beginning of the 1990s.3
  However, this boom has come at a cost, which we see now. The heart of Indian infrastructure reform has been the public–private partnership (PPP) model, seen as a way to raise funds on a large scale for resource-hungry projects that would otherwise go unfinanced if left to cash-strapped governments. Therefore, any attempt to understand what went wrong must come to grips with how we, as a country, implemented the PPP model, where we made mistakes and what needs to be fixed.
  This essay argues that the fundamental mistake we made was to see the private sector as mainly a way to bring scarce capital into infrastructure, but with little regard to putting in place enabling institutions, laws and processes that could put that capital to effective use. There was a ‘we’ll fix it later’ approach, not least on the part of government bureaucrats, who wanted to see real progress on the ground. As a result, it was only after committing finances, resources and manpower, that developers, bankers and governments discovered deeper, more basic problems with the sector in question. Some of these issues centred around regulation: who was to decide disputes, or handle customer complaints? Other issues centred around the role of the sovereign: should the government acquire land for infrastructure projects, or should the responsibility be that of the developer’s? One result of putting the cart before the horse in this way was that the sector went through a whole cycle. The private sector started out as contractors, progressed to being developers bringing in capital and managing all aspects of a project, and then went back to being contractors as, one by one, many ran into financial difficulties or faced serious hurdles in attempting to build out the project.

  The price of not fixing the mistakes we made will be high indeed. Infrastructure, more than any other sector, is an enabler to the rest of the economy, helping to lower the transaction costs of doing business. The ‘multiplier’ effect on GDP of an acceleration in infrastructure growth and build-out are estimated at 0.5–0.9 by the IMF for developing economies, but can go to as high as 5 for a sector such as the railways.4 A major reason for China’s extraordinary economic growth in the last few decades has been its focus on infrastructure. The country’s infrastructure capital stock grew by 12.3 per cent on average, between 1978 and 2008, compared to a GDP growth of 9.5 per cent in real terms over the same period. ‘Such a remarkable catch up in infrastructure has no doubt made a significant contribution to China’s rapid economic growth.’5
  The rest of the essay is structured as follows: In the next section we look at the developments centring around 1997 and 1998, which kick-started the reform efforts in infrastructure. We also look at the profile of private-sector players who entered infrastructure after its opening up, and how that has changed over the years. We then look at the broad developments in governance and policy that guided the development of the six infrastructure sectors covered in this essay—roads, civil aviation infrastructure, ports, power, railways and urban infrastructure. The learnings from the successes and failures in infrastructure over the last twenty years are covered, including changes in the recent policy environment, followed by suggestions for future reform.
  In this review, we do not cover two major sectors that are arguably seen as part of infrastructure—telecom, and oil and gas. Issues specific to these sectors are addressed elsewhere in this volume.6

1997–98: Year Zero for Infrastructure Reform?
Reform in the infrastructure sector began to gather speed only in the mid-90s. In 1996, the Expert Group on Commercialization of Infrastructure Projects, chaired by Rakesh Mohan, submitted a key report that outlined the challenges faced in developing Indian infrastructure and how to overcome them. That report was to effectively become a blueprint for reform in the sector; it addressed issues of both financing and regulation, and proposed, among other things, autonomous regulators for each sector, the separation of roles between a regulator and the entities actually operating infra projects, and the setting up of special purpose vehicles (SPVs) to channel funds for a specific project. Even at the time, the committee stressed the need for the different risks in a project to be ‘clearly demarcated and allocated to different stakeholders’.7 This was a prescient warning by the committee and, sadly, successive governments paid little heed.
  The year 1997–98 held the key when a whole set of reforms came together. The Infrastructure Development Finance Corporation (IDFC), which was to play such a pivotal role in financing infrastructure projects, was formed. It was also the year when the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Act (TRAI) was passed by Parliament, the year when the Tariff Authority of Major Ports (TAMP) was set up, and the private sector was allowed into ports through an amendment in the Major Port Trusts Act.8 Additionally, an ordinance was introduced that brought into being the apex regulators in the electricity sector at both the Centre and state levels.9 And while the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) was set up two years earlier in 1995, it was in 1997–98 that the capital base of the authority, which was to play a key role in the development of highways in the country, was expanded to Rs 500 crore, even as the giant National Highways Development Project (NHDP) was instituted.
  Parallel to the efforts at the Centre, many state governments also took the initiative to revitalize infrastructure. States such as Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu were especially entrepreneurial in this regard. Even a state like Punjab, not usually seen as being as dynamic in terms of economic policy as the others in the list, took novel initiatives. The state set up the Punjab Infrastructure Development Board in 1998 under a newly passed state law and staffed it with high-level officials with access to specially earmarked funds raised through cesses. Given legal backing, it bid out PPP projects in a range of sectors—from roads to industrial training institutes to bus terminals.
The Entry of the Private Sector
How did the private sector respond to the new opportunities offered by the opening up of infrastructure?
  Even before the opening up of India’s economy in the 1990s, there were a set of private-sector players who had deep experience of, and knowledge in, large-scale infrastructure. These were companies such as Larsen and Toubro, Gammon, and Hindustan Construction Company, who had a history of executing large-scale construction projects, including in public infrastructure.
  Interestingly, some players in this category were relatively more cautious in their approach, at least initially, towards the advent of PPP projects, given the additional risks the model entailed (such as taking on the onus of financing the project). But with their national, and indeed, even then, international experience in construction, these players were ideally placed to take on the new emerging opportunity, which they did despite their initial reluctance.
  A second group of such players also had strong experience in public works, but were much more regionally concentrated. Chief among these were a clutch of companies from undivided Andhra Pradesh—Lanco, Nagarjuna Construction, and Navayuga, among others—who had specific experience of working on large dams and irrigation projects in the state.
  A third set of players had little initial experience of public infrastructure, to begin with, but had established industrial businesses, which they used as a base to leap into the sector to take advantage of the new opportunities; these included a diverse set of companies such as Zee, Reliance, and GMR and GVK. Unlike the aforementioned groups of players, their initial experience of infrastructure was as developers.
  A fourth set of players also had little prior experience of infrastructure, but had backgrounds in the financial-services industry. These included the likes of IDFC (mentioned earlier) and Srei. In recent years, a subgroup in this category have become prominent investors in India’s infrastructure industry. These are primarily a clutch of foreign private-equity funds such as Blackstone, Brookfield, KKR, and pension funds such as the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, and PSP (also from Canada). In fact, foreign players such as these now provide the much-needed liquidity and exit opportunities for developers who are heavily weighed down by debt from past projects and have little financial bandwidth to complete current projects or bid on new ones.
  Irrespective of which firm falls in which category players have, however, developed a wide set of learnings from the experience of the last two decades. My own firm, Feedback Infra, is a case in point. It started out as an advisory and consulting firm, helping infrastructure majors’ plan and develop project reports in the early 1990s. In the late 1990s, it moved to designing the first industrial parks then being promoted by different governments. However, it was only in 1989–99 that it positioned itself as a full-fledged infrastructure engineering and technical services company. From then on, it built over a decade’s worth of experience, and it was in this phase that the company came to grips with the nuts and bolts of providing a comprehensive set of services for creating infra assets. In 2010, it moved to explore new opportunities in ‘Managing and Operating’ newly constructed infrastructure assets with three O & M subsidiaries. And it was only last year that it expanded to participate in new projects overseas in geographies such as the Gulf, Africa, South and South East Asia. In different ways, its journey has kept pace with the growing infra opportunities that India and emergent markets are throwing up as the sector evolves; with around 9000 employees, it has clearly emerged as one of the largest providers of infrastructure-related services in South Asia.
Roads
With the setting up of NHAI and the introduction of the NHDP in 1998, the stage was set for the biggest build-out of the road network the country had ever seen. Between 1951 and 1991, the total length of surfaced roads grew at the rate of about 24,000 kilometres per year. In the twenty years after 1991, they grew at the rate of about 70,600 kilometres per year, under the combined efforts of two giant road-building programmes, both of which were kicked off between 1998 and 2000.10
  The NHDP poured around Rs 2,02,700 crore into adding or upgrading the country’s national highway network, which, though accounting for just 2 per cent of road length, carries around 40 per cent of traffic. The NHDP and other investments in national highways accounted for about 35 per cent of total investment in the roads sector between 2002 and 2012—a quantum of investment heavily implemented through PPPs using a standard or ‘model’ concession agreement between the NHAI and private developers.
 
  The Road Network has expanded sharply in the last twenty years . . .

  Concurrently, even as the NHDP set about transforming the country’s highway network, the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (implemented by states, but under central-government guidelines) was having the same effect on rural connectivity at the local level. Between 2002 and 2012, around Rs 1,04,000 crore was spent under the scheme, leading to an additional 3,50,433 kilometres of rural roads being laid or upgraded under the scheme. Going beyond this, state governments poured an additional Rs 4,28,300 crore into the sector. Funding for highways construction was largely raised from cesses on diesel and petrol paid by vehicle owners.
  But while the first two phases of the NHDP went off relatively well, subsequent phases saw a sharp slowdown. The third phase of the NHDP was scheduled to finish by 2012 for instance, but only 54 per cent of the targeted road length had been completed by then. Indeed, in recent years, the NHAI has again begun to implement road projects under the EPC (engineering, procurement, construction) model, with the private-sector player being relegated to the role of a contractor.
  The key problem was an incomplete institutional structure. While the NHAI and the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) are signatories to PPP agreements, they also manage policy and guidelines for PPP projects, a situation rife with possibilities for conflict of interest. Private developers were also forced to take on tasks, such as acquiring land, for which they were ill-suited.
Ports
The development of the Indian ports sector sharply highlights—perhaps even more than the roads sector—how differences in the regulatory environment can affect private participation in a sector. Further, the experience of PPPs in the ports sector highlights the critical role played by state governments in promoting private investment in infrastructure.
  Since the 1960s, there have effectively been two regulatory regimes in the private sector. Twelve ‘major’ ports (the largest in the country) operate under the jurisdiction of the central government, with each port being owned and operated by a trust. Reforms in the 1990s aimed at corporatizing such ports and outsourcing port services to private operators. Tariffs for such services were regulated by a new regulator—the Tariff Authority for Major Ports.11
  The proposed reforms never really got off the ground. Only Ennore port was corporatized, and the lack of freedom to ports to set tariffs proved to be a disincentive to private investment. In 2011, a study into the problems of major ports by a Parliamentary Standing Committee observed, ‘Despite considerable degree of operational powers the port trusts formed under the Major Port Trust Act lack teeth and suffers in executing power and authority.’12
  Under the National Maritime Development Programme of 2005, the government had proposed 276 projects to be implemented between 2005 and 2012, worth a total of Rs 55,800 crore, to modernize major ports, including projects to construct or upgrade new berths, and add satellite infrastructure. Of this investment, 60 per cent was to come from the private sector.
  Actual results have fallen short. Five years into the programme, an EY report noted that only fifty projects (less than one-fifth of what was planned) were completed at a cost of Rs 5700 crore. Among the problems, it pointed to ‘delays in obtaining approvals from the Ministry, in clearance from the Ministry of Environment and Forests as well as state pollution control boards, and in tendering and contract procedures’.13 Forty-five projects worth Rs 18,415 crore were under operation at major ports as of April 2016.14 Yet, despite these failures, major ports have seen improvements in efficiency in the last couple of decades, with average turnaround time for ships going down from 6.7 days in 1991–92 to 3.89 days in 2014–15.15
  The second regulatory regime covered the 200 so-called ‘minor’ ports. These were owned and operated by state governments who proved far more successful in attracting investment. As a result, the minor ports’ share of total cargo traffic handled rose from 25 per cent in 2001–02 to 39 per cent in 2011–12. According to a report by the National Transport Development Policy Committee: ‘This has largely been due to lower levels of regulatory and financial control compared with Major Ports. Non-Major Ports have been more successful in attracting higher private investment, because they are perceived to be more business-oriented, customer-friendly, cheaper and, in general, more efficient.’16 As part of the ongoing reforms in the sector, there is talk of doing away with TAMP altogether and redesigning the regulatory regime.17
  The other big problem facing ports has been the development of satellite infrastructure, such as road and rail connectivity. To fix this problem, the Union Cabinet recently approved the Sagarmala project, which aims at development of ports and local industrial clusters with satellite infrastructure. Under this project, 104 initiatives worth around Rs 70,000 crore have been proposed.18
Power
Of all the sectors covered in this essay, it is perhaps the power sector that saw the strongest institutional development in the early years of reform. Based on policies first introduced with the help of the World Bank in Odisha in the mid-1990s, the reform process essentially involved ‘unbundling’ of vertically integrated public-sector power utilities into separate entities involved in generation, transmission and distribution of power. The idea was to bring private-sector participation in each of these entities over time, with an independent regulator overseeing the sector, arbitrating disputes, and being responsible for consumer interests. In 1997, the government introduced an ordinance setting up such independent regulators at the central and state levels. The Electricity Act in 2003 was a major piece of legislation, which embedded in law many of the reforms in power that had been proposed in earlier years. The ultimate aim was the creation of a single national ‘market’ for power with multiple buyers and sellers.

  The setting of power tariffs was, and is, a deeply political issue. State governments kept low the tariffs charged to important political constituencies such as agricultural users or domestic consumers, with tariffs over time falling well below the cost of supply. To offset this, tariffs on industrial consumers were kept high. Despite this, the difference was rarely made up, and state power utilities faced chronic deficits, leading to multi-thousand crore losses. It was hoped that the newly created ‘independent’ regulators would enable the setting up of a tariff structure that was far more rational and less riddled with cross-subsidies, thus leading over time to state utilities achieving financial viability.
  In actual practice, successes have been few and far between. State regulators have often not turned out to be as independent of state government control as needed. Further, in a number of states, distribution companies have remained state-owned. The end result has been that the biggest buyers in the national ‘market’ for power have been chronically bankrupt and have remained so.
  Despite this, the years after 2003 saw a flood of investment, especially in generation. As in roads, a model concession agreement (MCA) set the framework for governance under which the private-sector generation companies operated.
  But ultimately, the private sector ran into three serious problems. First, the flood of investment into power generation presupposed adequate domestic supplies of coal. However, the coal sector had seen little reform, with the state-run Coal India having a monopoly over coal mining. There was also an opaque policy by which domestic coal was allocated to buyers. In such an environment, a desperate rush to secure cheap, domestic supplies of coal set the state for a major corruption scandal, involving the coal market. When domestic supplies dried up, power projects turned to international markets to buy coal at a time when global coal prices as much as tripled between 2006 and 2011.19
  The second problem that projects faced was that their ability to revise power tariffs in line with increases in the coal price was severely limited by conditions in the MCA. Thus, most private-sector thermal power projects were unviable from day one.
  Finally, in power, as in other sectors, the inability to demarcate risks under a PPP contract correctly meant that the private sector was saddled with tasks it was unfit for, such as acquiring land or getting environmental clearances. As a result, many projects stagnated for years and still do.
  Efforts were made to fix these problems. The government subsequently allowed power-purchase agreements to include clauses allowing for tariffs to track increases in the price of coal. So-called ‘Ultra Mega Power Projects’ were bid out to private developers only after putting in place environmental clearances and with clearly identified captive coal mines as a source of supply.
Civil Aviation
Of the eighty-four operational airports in India, six airports situated in India’s largest cities (and accounting for 60 per cent of air traffic) are operated under PPP mode. A further eight are privately run or run by respective state governments, with the remaining being operated by the Airports Authority of India (AAI), a state-run institution. There has been a separate independent regulator for airports since 2007, governed by its own legislation. The Airports Economic Regulatory Authority also has the power to set various fees and tariffs imposed on passengers by airports.
  From one perspective, the private sector’s involvement in the airport sector has been successful. As a recent report on the transport sector in India has pointed out: ‘These airports are not just fit-for-purpose but are comparable with the very highest international benchmarks on several fronts.’20
  However, the same report also pointed out that landing and usage fees at the new, modern airports are among the highest in the world.21 Increases in fees sought by airport operators have ranged from 100 to 400 per cent and has led to widespread complaints from both airlines and passengers. Part of the problem is due to the fact that some tariffs were held constant from 2001, and so, when they were raised, had to be hiked substantially to compensate. Even so, the report concludes that while it is fair for development of airports to be funded by user charges, the development of modern airports, ‘have been achieved at a price that may be considered untenable’.22
Railways
Of all the sectors covered here, it is the railways that have seen the least structural reform and the poorest performance in terms of attracting private investment. The main reason for this failure, as a major report on railways restructuring issued last year pointed out, was the fact that three critical roles—policymaking, regulation and operations—were all vested with the Indian Railways. ‘There is a clear conflict of interest when the policymaker and regulator is also a competitor. As long as this is the case, private players will always suspect that the schemes are tilted in favour of [Indian Railways] or one of its PSUs.’23
  At least since 1992, there have been various attempts by railways to involve the private sector. Schemes to get the private sector to own and lease wagons to the railways (thus augmenting rolling-stock) or schemes to get the private sector into operating special types of trains (container trains, freight trains, etc.) have been proposed at various times, but have seen only mixed success.
  A major reason has been that such schemes, in different ways, favoured the Indian Railways’ own services. Often, high user charges were imposed by the Indian Railways on private operators for use of railway infrastructure. A lack of coordination between different railway zones added to problems in implementation.
  Another major project by the railways, aimed at involving the private sector, is the Dedicated Freight Corridor project, initiated in 2005, which aimed at creating specialized routes for freight trains on certain routes. This has been a key problem for the Indian Railways since freight and passenger trains run on the same line, thus creating blockages in freight movement. Again, there has been lack of action on the ground, with policies favouring the Indian Railways over the private players.24 Delays in tendering, land acquisition and frequent changes in management have also bedevilled the project.25
  The slow progress in adding to infrastructure in the railways has meant that more and more freight traffic, the railways’ main revenue source, has moved to the roads network. The railways’ share in total interregional freight traffic has fallen to 30 per cent in 2007–08, from 53 per cent in 1986–87.26 The roads sector has received well over 60 per cent of funds channelled to PPP projects since 1991–92, compared with less than 1 per cent for railways (see Figure 2).

Urban Infrastructure
The bulk of urban infrastructure projects in the PPP mode have been in the field of transport—especially metro rail. These include the Hyderabad and Mumbai metro projects, the Gurgaon rapid metro and the Delhi metro’s airport-line project. More recently, the current government’s smart-cities project and the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation covering 500 cities were successors to the earlier Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, which was the first large scheme to encourage states to use the PPP mode to improve urban infrastructure. Since 1991–92, around Rs 43,000 crore of urban projects have been executed in the PPP mode, with over Rs 33,000 crore being in metro rail alone.27
  However, successes outside metro rail have been few and far between. The regulatory framework governing the build-out of urban infrastructure can often be the most complex and difficult of all to design and implement. Large cities have multiple agencies with overlapping jurisdictions on land ownership and development and other critical municipal functions. A private developer looking to implement such a project must not only deal with such agencies but with well-entrenched and influential special interests. ‘Lack of urban planning, and clear laws, regulations and procedures has resulted in a slowdown of urban infrastructure projects,’ a recent committee, chaired by Vijay Kelkar and set up to recommend changes to India’s PPP model, pointed out.28
  It is in such urban infrastructure projects that the role of state governments is paramount. Projects in water supply and sewerage are very much issues under the ambit of state governments, rather than central governments. Apart from this, the multiplicity of clearances and regulations affecting such projects are typically under state-government control.
Problems with the PPP Model
What were the flaws with the PPP model in India, which led to multiple projects facing a cash crunch, bankers facing the risk of loans not being paid back, and developers on the brink of bankruptcy? All three of the major stakeholders in a PPP project—the government, the private developer, the banks—must share the blame.
  When PPP projects first started being bid out, they were met with scepticism from potential private-sector players who were wary of the broad set of risks, including financial ones, that the model entailed. Subsequently, however, they shed their inhibitions and embraced the PPP model, mainly out of a fear that if they remained contractors, they would be rendered redundant. Certain other groups also wholeheartedly embraced the PPP model as they saw an opportunity for gaming the system with ‘cronyism largesse’ and cosying up to the political establishment.
  This fear of being left out of the race for projects that competitors were bidding for, or the lure of quick riches, meant that investments were often taken on with little regard for potential problems—not just in individual sectors but in the overall design of the contract. The pipeline of projects offered for bidding in most sectors has often turned out to be erratic, leading developers to be even more aggressive in attempting to win the few projects on offer.
  In the race to bag a project, private developers often bid in a way that seemed ‘irrational’ and at levels that made it virtually impossible for a project to be viable. Why did this happen? Many such ‘irrational’ bids were made on the basis of projections that were unduly optimistic. But in some cases, such ‘irrational’ bids were made because the private developer was confident that they would be able to ‘renegotiate’ contract terms subsequently—and on more favourable terms—due to political connections.
  Further, as a recent report on PPP projects pointed out, many developers also gamed the system, having little to lose. ‘By inflating the Total Project Cost (TPC), developers achieve financial closure at an amount substantially greater than reasonable TPC and thereby source higher debt than the actual requirement. If the project is then jeopardized, the funds at risk are those of the lenders as there is virtually no “skin in the game” by the developer.’29
  Compounding this problem was the source of funding. In India, unlike in the rest of the world, infrastructure was funded to a major extent by commercial banks. This created the potential for serious ‘asset–liability mismatches’ since banks raise funds from depositors for tenures of at most seven to ten years, while infrastructure projects pay off over a much longer period of thirty years or more.
  Yet, this problem (flagged by numerous experts and observers) was ignored and commercial banks were encouraged to fund infrastructure projects in India. Indeed, the share of bank loans to infrastructure projects rose from 13 per cent in 2002 to 31 per cent in 2015. Moreover, banks were also afflicted by the ‘me-too’ syndrome that affected developers. They rushed in to fund projects whose economics were questionable from the very beginning. If Indian banks are reeling from non-performing assets (NPA) to the tune of Rs 2,64,200 crore currently, they must bear a large share of the blame themselves. And if developers were indeed gaming the system—as the Kelkar Committee Report recognized—the oversight on project costs that financiers should have exercised was not forthcoming.

If developers and bankers were knee-deep in problems of their own making, successive governments added to the problem. As pointed out earlier, policymakers saw PPP primarily as a source of scarce capital to develop infrastructure. Ironically, this is precisely the reason that makes PPPs unnecessary, since governments can often raise funds at lower costs compared to private developers.
  In seeing PPPs as a channel through which private-sector funds could flow into much-needed infrastructure projects, government ignored the critical need to build institutions that would enable that capital to be deployed effectively. The measures to ensure that the private sector would not be called upon to bear risks for which it was ill-equipped (acquiring land or getting environmental clearances), and the measures for an independent regulator who would impartially decide disputes between the private developer and the government were either implemented incompletely, or not at all, in many sectors. The general attitude within governments was to focus on getting the investment in and then set about fixing the regulatory and policy environment.
  As a result, when difficulties such as those over acquiring land, securing environmental clearances et al. became manifest from the late 2000s onward, the private sector increasingly began to see the government as having ‘abandoned’ them to solve such problems on their own. This was when, as roads minister in the current government, Nitin Gadkari, pointed out in an interview last year: ‘I feel 90 per cent of the projects were stalled because of the government either at the Centre or in states.’30 Overall, there was a sense within the private sector that it was not being treated as an equal partner in a given project.
  Finally, the MCA system was far too inflexible. It applied a ‘one-size-fits-all’ solution to projects in a sector. There was little recognition of, and little allowance for, nuances and differences across projects or for the ability to renegotiate terms in case of unforeseen events. The Kelkar Committee acknowledged this problem and laid down a basic framework to govern such renegotiations, including allowing such changes only if there was a clear danger to the project from events beyond the private sector’s control, and when such changes did not materially affect the risks taken on by the government.31
Measuring Investment in Infrastructure
There was one more key failure in institution-building on the part of the policymakers that was perhaps even more fundamental. For a long time, there was no clearly defined way set out by national statistical agencies or other policymaking bodies on how to measure capital formation in infrastructure. With such a methodology lacking, there was no way to set national targets on infrastructure investment, or to measure the extent to which those targets were being met. In a foreword to an earlier book by the current author, former Planning Commission vice chairperson Montek Singh Ahluwalia acknowledged this problem and introduced such a methodology (see Figure 8).32 However, while estimates of capital formation in infrastructure based on the new methodology were computed and released initially, the effort soon petered out and has not yet been revived.33
New Opportunities
Even as projects under the PPP mode have gone into steep decline, almost by default, governments have stepped in—or stepped in again—to fill the gap.
 
  Figure 8: GCFI (% of GDP)

  In his 2015 Budget, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announced the creation of a National Infrastructure Investment Fund (NIIF) with an ultimate corpus of around Rs 40,000 crore to provide long-term capital to infrastructure projects, including stalled ones. This comes at a critical time when bank funding to infrastructure has virtually dried, as funders grapple with NPAs. Notwithstanding other sector-specific initiatives such as the Sagarmala project mentioned earlier for the ports sector, or the fact that the NHAI has once again begun to resort to the EPC mode to revive investment in highways, newer opportunities are beginning to emerge for private-sector players.
  For instance, one area long neglected in infrastructure investment has been the issue of maintenance of infra assets that have already been completed. Such maintenance is critical if the asset is to last as long as was envisaged in the original concession agreements. The infrastructure boom in the 1990s and up to the mid-2000s has created a large pool of such assets, which need to be maintained on a regular basis; this affords a big opportunity to a range of players to specialize in this sub-sector of infrastructure.
  The attempt by banks to clean up the mess of NPAs in infrastructure has also begun in earnest, with a number of investors looking to set up specialist funds targeting stressed assets even as the government has announced it will inject further capital of up to Rs 23,000 crore into state-owned banks. The RBI is playing its part by formulating new schemes and creating new avenues through which banks can get rid of, or revive, their bad assets. While the NPA problem in the Indian banking system extends well beyond infrastructure, fixing the problem remains a top priority if investment has to flow into infrastructure again. Meanwhile, a host of foreign investors, including international sovereign wealth funds and pension funds, have been actively scouting for infra assets in India for some time now. The payoffs from these assets are well suited to the long-term investment horizon of such funds.
The Way Forward
Fixing the NPA problem or reviving investment through the EPC mode can go only part of the way towards solving India’s infrastructure deficit in the long term. Fixing institutional problems is key, not just to revive sentiment in the sector but to ensure that the problems we saw in the last decade or so do not reoccur. Here is what must happen:34
1. The proposal by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, called ‘3P India’, to set up an advisory body-cum-think tank for PPPs needs to be revived. The body was initially proposed in Jaitley’s first Budget but never saw the light of day.
2. Redraw the schedule of risks in a PPP project and how they are allocated. The Ministry of Roads has taken a step forward in this regard with its hybrid annuity model by removing traffic and tolling risks from within the developer’s purview. In the power sector, newer bidding formats address issues such as fuel price risk.
3. Creating independent regulators is key. Independent regulators give the private sector a level of comfort that their concerns will be addressed in an impartial manner.
4. The Kelkar Report has laid out a basic set of guidelines on the context and conditions under which PPP contracts can be renegotiated. Create a separate renegotiation commission to handle such cases as and when they come up, as the Economic Survey itself has recommended.
5. It is critical that the role of commercial banks in infrastructure funding comes down, and a greater proportion of infra funding is raised from specialized lenders, such as insurers, who are far better prepared to handle the asset-liability mismatches and other related risks.
6. Finally, governments must resist the temptation to bid out projects without all major central and state clearances in place.
The Eleventh Five-Year Plan saw a huge push towards building the world-class infrastructure that India’s citizens deserve and desperately need. The share of private investment in this infrastructure build-out jumped from 22 per cent in the Tenth Plan, to 37 per cent in the Eleventh Plan.
  The Twelfth Five-Year Plan projected an investment of about Rs 55.75 lakh crore in infrastructure (at current prices) between 2012 and 2017. It also projected a higher share of that investment from the private sector—at 48 per cent.35
  But even during the Eleventh Plan, as investment poured in, the limits and constraints became increasingly obvious, for all the reasons mentioned above. As a result, the shortfall in the first two years of the Twelfth Plan in private investment has been about 43 per cent. The shortfall in public investment has been of the order of 20 per cent.36 According to the Kelkar report, ‘Over the period 2013–30, India is currently projected to have the world’s largest need for infrastructure investment, and the second-largest infrastructure deficit based on its average spending during 1992–2011.’37
  Until and unless these problems are fixed, that deficit is unlikely to be met.

HUMAN DEVELOPMENT: MILES TO GO

Liberalization sans Liberalism: The Control Raj and the Perils of Ideology and Rents in Higher Education
Devesh Kapur
The expansion of higher education in India in this period has been the most rapid in human history after that of China’s, suggesting that India has overinvested in higher education relative to its income. The biggest question concerning this explosive growth in Indian higher education is the quality of the millions of graduates. The core reason is the absence of quality faculty. The university system in India is the collateral damage of Indian politics. A superstructure of higher education on weak foundations of schooling is bound to fail.
Introduction
In the quarter century since the historic pivot in India’s economic policies, its economy has transformed, albeit with vast unevenness across sectors. In the transportation sector, aviation and highways have seen massive change, but a change in railways has been much more gradual. While the IT sector barely existed a quarter century ago, today it is India’s most dynamic sector, accounting for about 7 per cent of GDP. Agriculture, on the other hand, continues to be shackled by countless government interventions in input and output markets, all in the name of protecting farmers, most of whom continue to live precarious lives.
  One sector where so much has changed and yet so little (or as the French would say plus ça change, plus c’est la même chose) is higher education. The expansion of higher education in India in the past quarter century has been the most rapid in human history, after that of China’s. But in many ways, this quantitative transformation of Indian higher education in the post-liberalization period has served to entrench the status quo of government control, which has resulted in enormous rent-seeking and vitiated some of the core purposes of higher education, be it providing a deep pool of skilled labour, creating an informed citizenry or becoming the wellspring of knowledge creation that addresses the country’s myriad challenges.
  This paper first documents the rapid growth in higher education in India over the past quarter century. It then examines the characteristics of this growth, focusing on inherent tension among growth, cost, quality and access; mismatches in labour markets and sectoral mismatches in supply and latent demand; and the paradox of a large skill premium despite massive increases in supply, even as underemployment among the college-educated has been rising. The third section analyses the political economy of higher education in India and argues that the deeply entrenched ideology of control that persisted for nearly half a century among India’s political, bureaucratic and intellectual classes with regard to industrial policy continues in fundamental ways in higher education. In many cases, the justification has been equity and social justice; in others, ideological control has been a more important factor. The end result has been a sector that has emerged second only to real estate with the highest intensity of black money, and which has haemorrhaged talent, the very factor fundamental to building it. The paper concludes by suggesting some pathways for reform but is not sanguine in the absence of new political thinking on this vital issue.
Massification in Indian Higher Education
When India became independent, its human-capital indicators were dismal in almost all dimensions. The literacy rate was barely 18 per cent (1951). But relative to this abysmal low level of literacy, India had the foundations of a higher-education system with 0.4 million students enrolled and a gross enrolment ratio (GER) of 0.7 per cent, with thirty universities and 695 colleges (1950 figures). Post-Independence, there was a burst of higher-education institution-building by the central government for about two decades, which petered out over the next two decades. In the latter period, the system expanded through state universities, and by 1980, 2.9 million students were enrolled in 133 universities and 4722 colleges, which increased to 4.9 million students in 193 universities and 7346 colleges in 1990–91, as economic growth increased in the 1980s.
  Growth in higher education accelerated post economic liberalization. By the turn of the century, 8.4 million students were enrolled in 256 universities and 12,806 colleges. A decade later, the number of students had jumped to 18.7 million and by 2014–15, 26.6 million students were enrolled in 711 universities and 40,760 colleges.1 The GER surged from 8.1 per cent in 2000–01 to 23.6 per cent in 2014–15.
  In the 1980s student enrolment grew by 0.2 million annually, which increased to 0.35 million annually in the decade after the onset of economic liberalization. In the first decade of the 21st century, enrolments were growing at 1 million annually, which doubled to more than 2 million annually in the current decade—an order of magnitude increase in annual enrolment over three decades.
  The surge in higher education masks large variations across the country. While the GER in Tamil Nadu is nearly 33 per cent, it’s barely 10 per cent in Bihar. Despite Kerala’s widely acknowledged leadership in schooling, its enrolment in higher education is the lowest among the southern states and even lower than states such as Maharashtra and Haryana. Among the worst-performing states (as measured by the GER), West Bengal is a surprising laggard, given its lead in this area in the first half of the 20th century
  The contrast between India’s record in schooling (where learning outcomes have severely lagged behind growth in enrolments) and the pell-mell growth in higher education poses something of a paradox. Indeed, most countries had much higher income levels when they achieved India’s current GER—about ten times higher in the case of the UK and about four times in the case of Japan and China, suggesting that India has overinvested in higher education relative to its income.
  Four principal factors have driven the expansion of higher education in India over the past quarter century. The first is simply the demographic momentum in the college-age population, with more than 30 per cent of the population below the age of fifteen and more than 5 million people entering the fifteen to twenty-four age group annually.
  Second, with the growth of secondary education, this demographic bulge is more prepared for higher education. While India’s record in primary education was dismal in the first half-century after Independence, the new millennium has seen a combination of public funding (notably Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan) and private efforts (both on the demand and supply sides), which have led near-universal primary enrolment. More recently, this wave has been moving downstream to the secondary level; the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan, launched in 2009 to create greater opportunities at the secondary-education level, is resulting in a substantial increase in India’s secondary-school cohort.
  Third, rapid economic growth and greater integration into the global economy has sharply raised the demand for people with knowledge and skills, resulting in high skill premiums (see Table 1). And finally, demand for higher education is being driven by major changes in the aspirations of the population as well as by state policy, which has targeted increasing the GER to 30 per cent by 2020.

The implications of this extraordinary growth have largely gone unnoticed. Consider this: between 2000–02 and 2014–15, the number of colleges in India increased from 12,806 to 40,760, which meant an average of more than five new colleges were established every day in this period and the number of students increased by 1.8 million annually (and higher-education teaching staff by nearly 40,000 annually). Clearly, when it came to entry, the regulatory system has been incredibly accommodative, unless, of course, one asks how this really happened and what happens inside these institutions, a point to which we will return later.
Characteristics of Growth
Countries all over the world have had to confront the ‘iron triangle of higher education’. A country seeking to rapidly scale and expand higher education must face the binding constraints of cost and quality. Between the three goals of scale, cost and quality, a country has the autonomy to choose only two. Scaling up rapidly while maintaining quality imposes prohibitive costs. Maintaining quality within limited budgets severely constrains growth. And scaling rapidly while limiting the financial burden on the public exchequer inevitably means a shift to the private sector and has implications for quality as well.
  Even prior to the onset of economic liberalization, Indian higher education was in poor shape. The majority of students were enrolled in state universities, which had been severely undermined by student unrest and political interference during the 1970s and 1980s. After the heyday of institution building by the central government in the 1950s and 1960s, there was a hiatus of nearly three decades before the central government committed to expanding the supply of national-level higher-education institutions during the Eleventh Five-Year Plan. This included setting up of fifteen new central universities, including conversion of three state universities into central universities, eight new IITs (Indian Institutes of Technology), seven new IIMs (Indian Institutes of Management), five new IISERs (Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research), two new schools of SPAs (Planning and Architecture), ten new NITs (National Institutes of Technology), twenty new IIITs (Indian Institutes of Information Technology). Additionally, there were plans to build one new ‘model college’ in each of the 374 educationally backward districts (whose GER for higher education was less than the national average). The NDA government, in turn, approved an additional six new IITs and seven IIMs so that by 2016, twenty-three IITs and twenty IIMs were in existence. In addition, large sums were committed to elite vanity projects like Nalanda and SAARC University.
  Nonetheless, while central-government institutions continue to be the leading higher-education institutions within the country, about 94 per cent of all students enrolled in government institutions are enrolled in colleges and universities run by state governments, and more than half of all students enrolled are in private colleges (many affiliated to state universities), especially in professional degree programmes such as engineering, business and pharmacy.
  India had about 3000 seats in engineering at the time of Independence. By 1968, the number had increased by an order of magnitude (to 28,000), and by 1985, there were 57,888 seats, but already 58 per cent were in private institutions, mainly in South India and Maharashtra.2 By 2016–17, the number had increased almost twenty-seven times to 1,553,711, of which just 67,571, less than 5 per cent, were in government colleges.3 At the onset of economic liberalization, India had about fifty business schools, mainly in public institutions. In the 1990s, the number rose sharply to about 700 in 2000 and then ballooned to about 2,000 in 2009. Seats in business schools increased fourfold from 94,704 in 2006–07 to 3,85,008 in 2012–13. Barely 1 per cent of business school seats are in India’s IIMs and about 10 per cent or so in postgraduate business programmes in public institutions.
  The private sector-led-supply response has made education an important economic sector in its own right, with value addition in education services in India soaring from $6.9 billion in 1990 to $44.6 billion in 2012. Increasingly, the rapid expansion of private higher education has meant that access depends on the ability to pay. Policy changes in the early 2000s led to a credit boom in bank loans for higher education, which grew from Rs 300 crore in 2000 to nearly Rs 62,000 crore in 2014, with escalating demand, presumably due to (at least in part) high rates of return in higher education. In addition, both the central and state governments introduced a range of schemes, such as interest subsidies on educational loans from scheduled banks for low-income students, a Credit Guarantee Fund Scheme for Education Loans, and massive increases in funding for fee reimbursement and scholarships by state governments.
  One major consequence of the dramatic expansion has been increased access, especially to hitherto excluded social groups. An important goal of higher education in socially hierarchical and stratified societies has been to serve as a ladder of social mobility. India’s constitutionally mandated ‘special provision’ or ‘compensatory discrimination’ (popularly known as ‘reservations’ based on caste) has preoccupied debates on higher education in India. Unequal representation in Indian higher education can be measured either as a stock variable (the college-educated as a proportion of the underlying population), a flow variable (the college-educated as a proportion of those in the college-age cohort) or a flow variable conditional on completing high school. The unequal representation in Indian higher education is increasingly largely due to inequalities at the lower rungs of the education ladder and only secondarily due to unequal access to tertiary education per se. In 1999, the higher-secondary completion (which is a necessary condition to enter the portals of higher education) rates for India’s low castes, tribals, upper castes and Muslims were 4.9, 4.4, 22 and 7.1 per cent respectively. By 2009, these had climbed to 9.4, 8, 33 and 10.6 per cent respectively (per cohort).
  The effects of affirmative-action policies on higher education have been extremely contentious, from its supposed ‘crowding out’ effects on better-prepared students from non-reserved categories, to the possible effects on less well-prepared students in the reserved categories in elite institutions. However, a study of affirmative action in engineering colleges in Maharashtra finds that the policy has largely worked, increasing attendance among the targeted students, improved results in exams and with little adverse effects on graduation rates, especially for SC, ST and women, but less for OBCs.4 Indeed, some of the strongest gains from the expansion of higher education are manifest in the participation of women in higher education, critically important in a strongly patriarchal society such as India’s. In 1950, just thirteen girls were enrolled in higher education for every 100 boys. This climbed to fifty-eight in 2000 and then jumped to eighty-six in 2014–15.
  At one level, the expanding role of the private sector in supplying higher education reflects a more dynamic economy, with rapidly growing service sectors that are more knowledge intensive, which in turn, create a greater demand for higher education. High private returns then justify the higher costs students are willing to incur to obtain that education. However, this understanding of changes in Indian higher education is incomplete. In terms of numbers, the demand for labour in services has been greatest in sectors such as construction (with demand for electricians and plumbers), restaurants and retail, all of which require skills but by no means a college degree per se.
  The labour demand–supply mismatch is both occupational as well as sectoral. If India’s agriculture universities were important in developing the new seed varieties that underpinned the Green Revolution, the meagre growth in productivity in Indian agriculture can at least in part be attributed to their neglect. To take an example of where higher education intersects with rural India, let us consider the supply of veterinarians. India is home to about 1.5 billion farm animals (including 700 million poultry). Annually, there are only 1735 graduates of veterinary medicine programmes—approximately 1 per cent of the number of engineering graduates—amounting to just over one student per million animals. A state like Bihar, where agriculture and the rural economy is still critical for the majority of its population, has less than five vets per million farm animals.
  While the private sector’s role is undoubtedly important where private rates of return are high, this has led to underinvestment in areas with high social rates of return. In other areas such as medicine—with both high private and social returns—the number of seats in medical colleges rose from 19,745 in 1985 to 52,205 by 2016, of which just above half (28,000) seats are in government medical colleges.5 In this case, students who have invested large amounts in their education will serve patients that ensure maximum returns on their investment. And there is no reason why doctors trained in government medical colleges will not do the same. Insisting on compulsory service in underserved areas as a licensing requirement would at least partly mitigate the acute shortages in rural India. However, while India today has nearly three times as many medical schools as the US, the severe misgovernance of medical education in the country by the statutory Medical Council of India (MCI), an organization captured by special interests, has gravely undermined the larger social good. It is interesting to note that all three branches of government have made almost identical observations about the MCI: Parliament,6 the Executive7 and the Judiciary.8
  The example of medical education underscores the role that professional bodies play in higher education and the pernicious effects of their institutional decay in the last few decades.
  The biggest question concerning this explosive growth in Indian higher education is the quality of the millions of graduates. What do they learn? What cognitive or non-cognitive skills do they have? What is their domain knowledge in their fields of study? No government is interested in finding out, but in almost every field, the answers are discouraging. A host of surveys suggest that between 75 to 90 per cent of graduates of engineering and business schools are unemployable. The figures for the majority of students who earn bachelor’s degrees in arts, science and commerce can be scarcely better. The result is that only few institutions have signalling value for employers, and these capture all the attention. The core reason is the absence of quality faculty. When the system (rapidly) expanded, so did alternatives in the private sector, and expansion became all about ‘hardware’ (land, buildings) rather than ‘software’ (faculty, staff, pedagogy, research). Indeed, Indian government documents on higher education have a sensibility akin to that of developing the fertilizer sector: investment = physical facilities = output. In one case, it is urea (in millions of tons); in the other, it is students (also in millions).
  Higher education is also the locus of knowledge creation. Analysis of publications data—an indicator of research output—shows that while there has been some progress, it has severely lagged the overall growth in higher education. In 1990, India’s GDP (using purchasing power parity), was 83 per cent that of China’s, while the number of publications was double that for China. By 2011, India’s GDP was 43 per cent that of China’s and, while its publications grew threefold, the ratio relative to China’s dropped to less than 30 per cent. China’s share of global publications in STEM fields grew to 11 per cent, and while India’s share edged upwards to a modest 3 per cent, the gap between the two countries widened even further when it came to highly cited articles.9
  However, it should be noted that much of India’s publications output is not from universities but from specialized research centres. The roots of this go back to the 1950s when India decided to separate research from teaching, resulting in students lacking exposure to research and researchers, unable to easily access talented students. In addition to publicly funded research centres outside the university system, there is also a growing body of research from the many research centres established by MNCs in India in the post-liberalization period, which can be observed especially in patent (rather than publications) data.
Political Economy of Higher Education
The university system in India is the collateral damage of Indian politics. The vast majority of government colleges in small towns offer dismal educational outcomes. For politicians, the benefits of the Licence Control Raj extend beyond old-fashioned rent-seeking by manipulating contracts, appointments, admissions and even grades in government-run colleges and universities, to the use of higher-education admissions for vote-banks and partisan politics and as a source for new entrepreneurial activities (in private higher education).10 India’s governance weaknesses beset public services more generally, and the shortcomings of higher education are simply one more manifestation of this affliction.
  Three key factors have shaped the political economy of India’s higher education. The first is the structure of inequality in India. The historic severe degree of educational inequality led to a populist redistributive backlash when hitherto marginalized social groups came to power. However, the resulting redistributive politics has for the most part focused on more ‘visible’ forms, which explains why Indian politicians have obsessed over reservations in elite institutions of higher education rather than improve the quality of primary and secondary schooling and the scores of state universities of abysmal quality.
  Second, palatable exit options made it easier for erstwhile Indian elites to be less obdurate in their opposition to increasing reservations. In 1990, India was reeling in the aftermath of a policy decision by a minority government to sharply increase affirmative action in government jobs and education, as recommended by the Mandal Commission. A decade later, the issue had faded away due to exit possibilities inherent in accessing international higher education or to the thousands of new private colleges. It is estimated that the number of Indian students studying overseas is around a quarter of a million, but in the last couple of years there appears to have been a sharp increase in the number of international undergraduate and master’s students from India to nearly 3,50,000, with almost as many Indian students in China as there are in the UK.11 If one assumes an average annual expenditure of $25,000 and 3,00,000 students overseas, Indians are spending around $7.5 billion annually on consuming higher education overseas.
  Finally, there has been a form of vertical integration between the role of politicians, policymakers and owners of higher-education institutions. This has significantly affected the level and composition of public funding in state budgets, with a shift from funding public institutions to students in private colleges. In the Andhra Pradesh budget for 2013–14, for example, while funding for higher and technical education was Rs 4081 crore, that for fee reimbursement and scholarships was Rs 5400 crore. The vast bulk of this went to private colleges, many of which were politically connected. It would not be an exaggeration to say that the privatization of higher education has been the result of well-aligned political incentives. The regulator (politicians) is also the owner (of private colleges), and the politicians pass budgets with increasing budgetary allocations for fee reimbursements in the name of social justice. The students then enrol in colleges run by the same politicians so that, effectively, the public pays to sustain their business ventures. While this has undoubtedly increased access, the quality of this access is moot.
Reforms
In the post-liberalization era, if the setting up of new colleges has been akin to a speeding bullet train, reforms in the sector have been slower than the languid movement of a goods train. But what happens inside these thousands of new higher-education institutions is a starkly different story, the result of a system that has failed to reform even as it expanded massively. Even though Indian states differ considerably in their economic performance and the political parties that dominate them, when it comes to state universities, virtually all are poorly governed, irrespective of the state concerned. The state universities charge little and teach little, yet there is little political pressure or leadership to undertake painful reforms. And the consequences are becoming apparent. The maximum number of new colleges opened in any state during 2013–14 was in Madhya Pradesh (five new colleges every week) even as one of India’s worst higher-education scandals (Vyapam) was unfolding in that state, driven by the reality that despite the huge expansion of higher education, students are still desperate to get into the few that have any signalling value in the labour markets.
  Severe governance weaknesses—of the regulatory system as well as within individual institutions—have resulted in Indian courts emerging as a significant actor shaping higher-education policy, often not for the better. The regulatory approach has been ‘command-and-control’, and universities are beset by direct and detailed prescriptions, with laws, rules, regulations, guidelines and policies set by the government and multiple regulatory bodies on virtually every aspect of higher education, be it admission policies, internal organization, fees and salaries, or the structure of courses and funding, although the sheer size of the system is forcing some degree of loosening. Sadly, an insistence on academic conformity ensures that creativity is the first casualty.
  Underlying this model is a deep-rooted distrust of allowing universities autonomy, even after their initial approval. That distrust has been so disempowering as to have contributed to the very mediocrity and poor governance among most Indian universities that it was meant to overcome but, ironically, has become the rationale for continued control. And a key stakeholder—faculty—is either absent (manifest in the acute shortage of qualified faculty) or, at best, poorly trained and rarely a flag bearer of professional norms and standards.12
  The regulatory structures governing Indian higher education were created for a system that has grown more than hundredfold from the time when it was put into place. Today, in the case of public institutions, scale effects dwarf the limited capacity of centralized systems of oversight and control. To take an example, the President of India was made an ex officio ‘Visitor’ to central higher-education institutions to lend the prestige of his office to a few national universities. As of 2016, the President was Visitor to 114 central institutions, including central universities, NITs, IITs and IISERs, under the administrative control of the Ministry of HRD, as well as other higher-education institutions under the administrative control of the Ministries of Shipping, External Affairs, Agriculture, Sports, Textiles and Chemicals and Fertilizers.13 One might imagine that the country’s highest constitutional office has a few other responsibilities. This example vividly illustrates just how the governance of higher education remains in a time warp, even as the sector has so profoundly transformed.
  Under the UPA government, attempts were made to overhaul the regulatory structures governing higher education, moving away from intrusive inspection-based processes to accountability through independent third-party validation, mandatory self-disclosures and objective evaluation schemes. These proposals were ostensibly meant to get the states to take a more differentiated approach towards a highly variegated higher-education sector, with a more hands-off ‘promotional and evaluative’ role for the set of upper-tier institutions, a more engaged ‘steering role’ in mid-tier institutions while confining active regulation to lower-tier institutions, and at the same time ending the artificial separation between the regulation of ‘technical’ education from other fields. Accreditation was seen as a central plank of these reforms to ensure that poorly performing institutions were dealt with swiftly. But that has happened very gradually.
  A series of Bills were introduced in Parliament to this effect. These included the National Accreditation Regulatory Authority for Higher Educational Institutions Bill that sought to make accreditation by independent accreditation agencies mandatory for all higher-education institutions; the Education Tribunals Bill to create a central tribunal and state-level tribunals to resolve disputes relating to institutions, faculty, students and regulatory authorities; and the National Commission for Higher Education and Research Bill to create an umbrella ‘super’ regulatory authority that would subsume the principal higher-education regulators (UGC, AICTE, the National Council for Teacher Education and the Distance Education Council). All the Bills stalled, mostly for good reasons.
  However, two reforms proposed by the UPA were resuscitated (albeit in somewhat different forms) by the NDA. During the tenure of the former, the National Development Council had approved setting up of fourteen ‘world-class universities’ (or ‘innovation universities’) across the Eleventh and Twelfth Plan periods on a PPP model. This led to the Universities for Research and Innovation Bill (2012), which sought to empower the central government to set up universities for research and innovation through notifications. It was a recognition of three realities: one, no Indian university was making it to the top rankings of global universities; two, that this would not occur under the prevailing regulatory structures; three, reforming the coagulated higher-education regulatory structure was politically unfeasible. These ‘innovation universities’ could be public or private. The Bill stalled. But in 2016, the finance minister in his Budget speech announced that an ‘enabling regulatory architecture will be provided to ten public and ten private institutions to emerge as world-class teaching and research institutions’. When and how that will happen remains to be seen.
  A second initiative is more likely. The UPA government had introduced the National Academic Depository Bill in 2011 to establish a national electronic database that would allow academic credentials to be easily verified and authenticated. While the Bill stalled, in September 2016, the NDA announced an initiative to digitize all academic records in secondary to tertiary-level institutions, with the National Securities Depository Ltd and Central Depository Services Ltd as implementing agencies. The move would improve the ‘plumbing’ of higher education and help mitigate academic fraud and facilitate job verification and background checks on candidates seeking employment or further education.
  In the Twelfth Plan Period, a new centrally sponsored scheme, the Rashtriya Uchchtar Shiksha Abhiyan, was launched to try and improve quality in state universities and colleges by channelling funding through new State Higher Education Councils. Its effects are as yet unclear. Perhaps the most encouraging initiative in higher education has been a new emphasis on ‘skilling’ with the creation of the National Skill Development Agency in 2013, targeted towards providing skills to 500 million people by 2022, an improbably unrealistic goal. Currently, the Government of India is funding skill-development activities through dozens of schemes spread across multiple ministries. These programmes provided skill development to 17.34 million young people from 2011–13. While some of this training is being done through government ITIs, most of the training is being delivered by private vocational training providers and assessing bodies, with the central government ministries providing funds to state governments for reimbursement of training and assessment costs. What exactly are the outcomes of this substantial programme will be an area of fertile research in the future.
Conclusion: What Does the Future Hold?
As the 21st century progresses, India will face unprecedented pressures on its natural resources, be it land, soil, air or water. The only resource it will have in abundance will be its people. The latter can either be harnessed to creatively address the challenges posed by the former, or they can add to the burden. While one is the path to India’s promise, the other is the road to perdition. While there are some green shoots, as matters stand today, it would be foolish to be sanguine.
  Two changes are fundamental if this ship is to veer course soon. First, a far greater effort to improve learning outcomes, beginning with early childhood development and primary and secondary schooling. India’s unacceptably high levels of stunting, which has pernicious implications for cognitive development, are a reminder that a superstructure of higher education built on weak foundations of schooling can only go so far.
  Second, drastic changes in the political and regulatory personnel in higher education, from education ministers to the UGC to vice chancellors of universities. At the heart of the weakness of policy and academic leadership is a political leadership that across political parties has shown depressingly little understanding of an issue so vital to the country’s future.
  India cannot replicate the brick-and-mortar university experience of the Western world. It neither has the resources nor the time given the scale and growth of the system and its extreme fragmentation. Higher education is the classic sector illustrating the Baumol–Bowen paradox of wage growth exceeding productivity growth and, in India, with promotions linked to age and wages to Pay Commissions (in public universities), the resources for a massive expansion of public higher education will simply not exist.
  A critical bottleneck is the lack of good faculty, one that simply cannot be addressed easily. The shortage of good faculty is acute across developing countries. The market for talent is global and overseas education can only partly mitigate this yawning gap. In the last two decades, for instance, Chinese nationals in the US received twice as many PhDs as Indian nationals—five times as many in mathematics and three times in the physical sciences (Table 2). India needs to follow Japan by allowing PhDs to be granted by working with qualified personnel in private R & D centres as well as in the many government scientific institutes and labs, perhaps by granting research personnel in these centres dual affiliation with universities.

While most private institutions are of poor quality, with no research facilities and a dearth of qualified faculty, a few new private institutions supported by philanthropy appear to promise higher quality and standards. But they too will not be the answer to the scale of the challenge. The problem is that successful higher-education institutions need to limit their growth in student enrolment to preserve their brand equity, one reason why the best higher-education institutions in the United States have seen their endowments grow much faster than the numbers of their students. And second, the knowledge-creation function of high-quality higher-education institutions requires large public resources to fund research. University research is a public good and even institutions such as Harvard get about half their budget from public research grants, underscoring the need for the Indian government to sharply increase funding for research with competitive research grants for both public and private higher-education institutions.
  Rather than fritter away limited public resources by setting up an IIT in one town, a central university in another and an IIM in a third, higher education needs to be integrated into urbanization strategies. The drivers of ‘smart’ cities will be creativity and innovation, which are increasingly rooted in higher education, but there are high threshold effects in the concentration of talent. India needs to stop creating new institutions and, instead, expand enrolment in its best institutions, doubling or even tripling in the best central-government institutions with creative land-use strategies.
  At the same time, India needs to embrace disruptive technologies in higher education via MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses).14 MOOCs will not solve all problems, but with 4G technologies becoming accessible across India, they can considerably alleviate the desperate need for quality teaching. And at least in professional education—where rent-seeking behaviour has been most manifest—India needs to move to common exit exams (as has been the case for decades in accounting) to ensure that architects, doctors, lawyers, programmers, etc. at least have a common minimal body of knowledge before they are allowed to practise. To achieve this, there needs to be major governance reforms in professional bodies, and their roles should be restricted to setting standards and establishing professional norms.
  These initiatives, while promising, are unlikely to fundamentally turn around the sector anytime soon, unless the country’s political leadership is much more cognizant of the deeply troubling consequences for the country’s future. Indian higher education has been massively shortchanging its youth, many of whom have illusory credentials, relatively large student debt and big aspirations, but neither the skills nor the jobs commensurate to their expectations. As the mind-numbing growth of higher education in India continues unabated, in the absence of wide-ranging reforms, something will have to give—and it probably will not be pleasant.

Healthcare in India: A Fork in the Road
Nachiket Mor, Diva Dhar, Sandhya Venkateswaran1
Wonder whether India could have achieved more during the last twenty-five years, and if a clear path ahead can be seen for the healthcare sector. Today, a child is almost three times less likely to die before completing five years of life, and a mother is half as likely to die while giving birth, than in 1990. But the experience of the last twenty-five years demonstrates that leaving the provision of healthcare to the invisible hand of the market is not the solution to achieving better health outcomes. In all high-performing healthcare systems, governments act purposefully to finance, plan and deliver healthcare services.
Introduction
Over the last twenty-five years, significant progress has been made in the health of India’s population. In 1991, of the 30 million children born in the country, over 2 million died before their first birthday, and 1,00,000 mothers died giving birth. By 2015, this number had more than halved for both mothers and children,2 and a child born in today’s India is expected to live ten years longer than a child born in 1991.3 Moreover, India has established itself as a credible, cost-effective manufacturer of medicines, supplying over 20 per cent of the world’s generics and about half the vaccines sold globally.4 In addition, it has rapidly become a destination for medical tourism, with the industry growing at an estimated rate of 30 per cent in 2015.5 The improvement in health outcomes has coincided with a period of higher economic growth and changes in health policy, both of which were driven in part by the economic reforms of 1991.
  While these achievements are worthy of celebration, India’s healthcare system faces a number of challenges. Nearly 1 million children still die before their first birthday6 and many infectious diseases, such as malaria and tuberculosis, have still not been eliminated. Around 7 per cent of households fall below the poverty line each year7 as a result of health shocks and high out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditures on health. India also has one of the highest rates of open defecation in the world,8 which is especially damaging to children’s health in densely populated areas.9 There is also a growing disease burden arising from non-communicable diseases (NCDs).10
  The central premise of the 1991 reforms was that a reduced role of the state would allow the economy to function more efficiently and lead to an increased rate of growth and poverty reduction. In the healthcare sector, while other countries were allocating (if only gradually) greater proportions of their budgets to healthcare, India kept tax-based funding mainly static at around 1 per cent of GDP,11 choosing instead to allocate higher amounts to other development and income-transfer programmes. Using these limited resources, India built a modest-sized public health delivery system. The system focused on maternal and child health, and the control of infectious diseases, leaving the rest largely to the invisible hand of the market. As a result, the growing private sector that emerged was unduly focused on secondary and tertiary care and, in response, instead of reviewing its overall approach to health, the government introduced several underfunded insurance schemes, which sought to enable the poor access to high-end private care.
  In the following paragraphs, we chronicle the principal reforms in the healthcare sector since 1991. We examine how India has fared between states as well as internationally. Our interstate and international analyses identify wide variations in health expenditure and health outcomes. We explore health system design features associated with achieving better outcomes in other countries, setting them on a path to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC). Furthermore, we look ahead and identify opportunities for India’s health system to change direction, given the lessons and experience from the twenty-five years since the reforms. This leaves us to consider: could India have achieved more during this period, and can we see a clear path ahead for its healthcare sector? Are there strategic design shifts that could help pave India’s way to UHC?
  In all high-performing healthcare systems, we see that governments play a significant role in their organization. In doing so, they have knowingly placed limits on customer choice; regulated prices; enforced prepayment by citizens over fee-for-service models; used resources to augment their tax-based funding; and encouraged the development of government-owned or non-profit purchasers that buy healthcare from integrated government or private providers. The underlying rationale for these approaches is to overcome market imperfections, such as information asymmetries, which exist between providers and consumers, and the fact that even well-informed consumers behave poorly with regard to their own healthcare.12
Changes in the Public Health Sector
While the overall government expenditure as a proportion of GDP has remained largely unchanged over the last twenty-five years, there have been a number of key reforms that have had a considerable impact on the functioning of the public health system. We discuss a few landmark initiatives here.
  The National Rural Health Mission (NRHM), launched in 2005, was one such measure. Key NRHM programmes, such as the Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY), a conditional cash-transfer scheme to encourage institutional delivery, came to dominate the healthcare landscape from 2005–14. During this period, public-sector health infrastructure expanded, the proportion of institutional births in the public sector dramatically increased and, while there are continuing concerns relating to attribution, during this period, most states showed a reduction in their infant mortality rate (IMR) and maternal mortality rate (MMR).13
  The NRHM signified a shift away from more traditional vertical programmes—which were ‘fragmented and inconsistent’, such as family planning in the 1960s and early 1970s, and diarrhoeal disease in the late 1980s and early 1990s—to more integrated and comprehensive interventions.14 However, the NRHM focused largely on maternal and child health with a small financial resource base. As such, the public-sector programme was not equipped to deal with the epidemiological transition, which took place during this period. The system was faced with a dual burden, as the leading causes of death shifted from communicable diseases to NCDs like ischemic heart disease, stroke and cancer, particularly cervical cancer.15
  During the post-1991 period of reforms, government spending on health remained low.16 In 2002, it reached an all-time low of 0.98 per cent of GDP.17 Though it went up nominally during the NRHM period, even now it remains at 1.4 per cent of GDP, far behind other BRICS18 countries and a number of other developing countries (see Table 2). At this level, public expenditure constitutes less than one-third of the country’s total expenditure on health, currently at 4.7 per cent of GDP.19 The majority of expenditure on health is therefore OOP through point-of-service (POS) payments made by individuals seeking healthcare.20
Growth of the Private Health Sector
Post-1991, central and state governments introduced policies to promote private investment in healthcare, which included the shifting of subsidies, like cheap land, and concessions for equipment.21 The imposition of taxes and duties on drugs and high-tech medical equipment were removed, and preferential allowances were given to doctors to set up private practices and nursing homes.22 In 2001, facility surveys estimated that, nationwide, the private sector included as many as 93 per cent of all hospitals and 64 per cent of all beds.23 The utilization of private healthcare also increased significantly during this period. Nationally, the percentage of private outpatient cases grew from 64 per cent in 1995 to 74.5 per cent in 2014.24 This expansion varied across states; for example, the percentage of private outpatient cases in 2014 in Bihar was 91.5 per cent, compared with 57.8 per cent in Himachal Pradesh.25 Private-sector growth provided the people of India access to a wide range of healthcare services that the government was unable to provide through the public sector.
  However, given its competitive, highly fragmented and demand-led character, the private sector has primarily focused on providing secondary and tertiary care. It has been unable to develop a high-quality health system capable of providing primary-care-led integrated care, which is essential for promoting wellness and well-being at the population level. This outcome is not surprising. Healthcare, unlike other goods and services, suffers from a number of structural infirmities, which make unfettered markets unsuitable for arriving at first-best outcomes. These include: (a) a lack of knowledge of one’s own health status; (b) a high level of price elasticity in the primary healthcare domain and a low level for secondary and tertiary care; (c) significant positive externalities or spillover effects, such as from vaccinations and population-wide reduction of disease burdens; (d) information asymmetry between the physician and patient; and (e) the unpredictability in healthcare expenditures at the level of the individual.26 Later in this chapter, we argue that purposeful intervention by the government is required to overcome these challenges.
Growth of Insurance Markets
The growth of the private sector increased the choice of healthcare services available. Yet, either it was entirely out of the reach of many Indians or contributed directly to the health-related impoverishment of many families.27 The parallel expansion of health insurance was seen as a mechanism to increase the level of prepayments into the system, reduce OOP payments and enable access to private secondary and tertiary care. High POS expenses at hospitals would be replaced with much more modest insurance premiums paid by a large pool.
  In 2000, citizens were permitted to voluntarily purchase private health insurance, leading to a boom in the private insurance market. In 2014, of those covered by health insurance, 26 per cent purchased it from the non-government sector.28 With a Rs 20,000-crore annual premium collected (Table 1), this sector also accounts for nearly 3 per cent of the country’s total health expenditures.29 The Employee’s State Insurance Scheme (ESIS) for white-collar workers has a design feature that requires employers and employees to contribute mandatorily to a central pool. The scheme has grown rapidly during this period and today covers over 78.9 million beneficiaries.30

The contributory, self-financed insurance schemes were developed to allow the rich access to high-end private hospital care without experiencing financial hardship. However, the poor and the middle-income earners were left either to pay for private care on an OOP basis, which they often could not afford, or access free care within the government sector. This was seen as inequitable, particularly since the government felt that it was unable to provide the necessary healthcare services at a sufficient level of availability and quality.
  Over the years, central and state governments have sought to make available insurance schemes to the broadly defined below-poverty-line (BPL) and informal-sector populations, who otherwise would be unable to access private care. While these schemes have attracted much political attention, and have covered nearly two-thirds of the population that have government insurance,31 they only receive a nominal percentage of GDP, and have not had a discernible impact on either well-being or financial protection. In total, all government health-insurance schemes cover 214 million people (see Table 1) and in 2014, they constituted nearly 0.02 per cent of GDP.32 Since these schemes were largely outsourced to commercial insurance companies, the opportunity to build state capacity to purchase better healthcare from the public and the private sectors, an important tool for quality control, was also not realized.
  The impact of insurance on reducing OOP payments and mitigating health shocks has been limited.33 OOP payments remain high at 62.4 per cent of total health expenditure.34 In 2004, about a quarter of the population could not access health services due to financial constraints,35 and in 2011, the burden of healthcare payment forced 60 million Indians below the poverty line.36 Furthermore, since both public and private schemes as well as private healthcare infrastructure are all skewed towards secondary and tertiary care (in-patient services), they do not take into account the fact that the population needs coverage for drugs and out-patient services.37 Insurance schemes, as we currently see them, have had limited impact on the overall health status of the population.
  In countries such as Brazil and Thailand, insurance schemes have increased the level of prepayment in the health system and reduced OOPs to a fraction of India’s costs (see Table 2). In these countries, citizens pay a predetermined amount or premium upfront for a healthcare package rather than POS user fees. Thailand, which has had a UHC scheme since 2002, has managed to provide essential health services to all, improve financial risk protection, and reduce the risk of a ‘catastrophic health expenditure’.38
  While, in principle, health insurance can address the challenge of POS costs for hospitalization, the experiences of countries such as the United States offer a cautionary tale of what actually happens in an entirely free-market environment. Since, at the point of care, irrespective of quantity supplied, with hospital insurance, the price of care is effectively zero for the consumer and fixed for the supplier, there is excess demand and overuse of hospital services, and underuse of primary care, which has to be paid for on an OOP basis. In the US, increases in health-insurance premiums in a free-market environment for healthcare provision have thus not been accompanied by commensurate improvements in the health of the population and have, instead, led to high inflation in healthcare costs. Thailand and the United Kingdom, on the other hand, have been far more successful in containing this problem and associated rates of inflation, with the establishment of a strong, free primary care and strict gatekeeping by the primary-care physician to advanced hospital-based care.39

India too has agreed to the principles of UHC, but is yet to develop a clear plan of action. With the exception of ESIS, its schemes have taken on the form of conditional cash transfers with the intent of allowing the poor access to the high-end private hospital sector and reduce financial risk. In the current scenario, this has further fragmented and reduced the already limited pool of funds available to the government and provided no incentive to promote overall health through a comprehensive healthcare package. This underlines the opportunity for design reforms in order to better address the needs of the population.
  Coupled with the low and almost fixed share of government expenditure on healthcare, the twenty-five years of reforms have thus essentially created a free market-oriented health system. While the government offers a reasonable breadth of maternal and child healthcare services, it provides only a minimal level of other healthcare services. In the future and as incomes rise, there is a possibility that we could see even low-income segments of the population move entirely to the private sector, even for maternal and child-health services. This would result in an even more skewed, top-level hospital-focused healthcare system with an inflated cost structure, increased levels of associated impoverishment and low levels of well-being. We look within India to better understand these trends, and outline a few key design changes to reorient India’s trajectory.
Healthcare trends: A glimpse within India
The twenty-five years post reforms have shown that there are wide state-level variations in health expenditures and outcomes. Increased financial resources, though useful, do not necessarily translate into improved health outcomes (see Figure 1). Since the reforms, states such as Bihar and UP have halved their IMR to 42 and 50 respectively (see Table 3), a notable achievement given their limited spending on healthcare. Whilst these states continue to have some of the poorest health indicators, they have shown a more rapid rate of change than other states, despite having lower health expenditure per capita (see Tables 3, 4). Conversely, Himachal Pradesh, despite having one of the largest per capita investments in health among all states, has not seen a proportional improvement in certain health outcomes. It spends almost ten times as much as Bihar, but its IMR has not reduced below 35 (see Figure 1).
  Understanding individual experiences of each state can provide important insights into healthcare models and design. For example, Kerala, often hailed as the ‘model state’ for healthcare,40 shows a trajectory that may not be ideal for other states to follow. Though it has achieved enormous progress in maternal, neonatal and child health, about 35 per cent of its adult population suffers from hypertension (see Table 4), nearly one-third of babies are born through caesarean section41 (well above the 10 per cent benchmark that is associated with reduced maternal and neonatal mortality),42 and there are higher mortality rates due to suicides43 and accidents.44 In addition, 83.7 per cent of health expenditure is OOP (Table 4).

  Tamil Nadu also finds itself in a challenging situation despite its many accomplishments. IMR has reduced by more than 60 per cent in the last twenty-five years (see Table 3) and there is near-universal institutional delivery (see Table 4) to the point that Tamil Nadu may no longer need resources and schemes such as JSY to incentivize institutional delivery. However, OOP remains above the national average at 77.6 per cent and more than one-fifth of its adult population suffers from hypertension (see Table 4). The current health system is clearly unable to cope with these emerging challenges.
  At the state level, health systems have evolved very differently with clear variations in achievement over the last twenty-five years, irrespective of financial resources. Whilst states such as UP and Bihar have demonstrated much progress, they have a considerable way to go in reducing even MMR and IMR, on which the government health system is almost exclusively focused. And, although the more advanced states, despite high levels of OOP payments (see Table 4), have achieved their IMR and MMR goals, they are doing poorly on several other critical health indicators. It is troubling to note that, over time, with the current laissez-faire design of the health system, in the best-case scenario, UP, Bihar and other poorer states will find themselves in the same position as Kerala and Tamil Nadu. It is important that poorer states learn from these challenges and consider purposeful health system designs that are responsive to the changing needs of their populations.

Where Do We Go from Here?
It is clear that we could have done more with our health systems over the twenty-five years since the post-reforms period. Though money is important, the answer is not to simply spend more. Government intervention, with specific health-system designs, needs to address market distortions and intervene in a meaningful way to overcome market failures and shocks that lead to health impoverishment and poor well-being.
  Thailand is a helpful case to study. Whilst it has increased its public health expenditure from around 2 per cent to 6 per cent of GDP,45 Thailand’s UHC programme demonstrates the value of deliberate policies to address specific healthcare challenges. For example, the provision of a comprehensive package of care resulted in a high level of financial risk protection,46 and the introduction of a provider-network gatekeeping function brought greater efficiency to the system.
  India is a diverse country in which there won’t necessarily be a ‘one-size-fits-all’ solution. Each state would need to evolve its own specific design to suit its needs. Nevertheless, there are some core design principles common to all high-performing health systems, which we discuss briefly below.
Increased Level of Prepayment
With tax-based allocations static at around 1 per cent of GDP during the post-1991 period, and government insurance schemes adding almost 0.02 per cent of GDP,47 about two-thirds of healthcare expenditure in India is at POS.48 This directly leads to low demand for primary care, high demand for hospital-based care, high rates of inflation in healthcare expenditures, and very poor population-level outcomes. The dominant healthcare financing structure in high-performing health systems is a combination of government finance and health insurance. In order to move in this direction, India could consider re-examining its spending priorities and allocating more resources to finance healthcare expenditure.
  Secondly, it could avoid further fragmentation of its limited tax resources by paying for the poor to access the private sector. Instead, India could consider a mandatory social-insurance scheme which the non-poor would also be required to purchase. A combination of these two measures has the potential to alter the structure of financing healthcare in India, as it has in other countries.
Purchaser–Provider Split
In the last thirty years, many countries have introduced a purchaser–provider split (PPS), separating third-party payers from providers of services. The application of PPS differs between countries. Some have opted for a principal national purchaser of services, whilst others, such as Finland, purchase services at a municipality level. As part of Turkey’s Health Transformation Programme, introduced in 2003, the adoption of PPS as well as other reforms such as universal general health insurance and a focus on primary care helped improve access, efficiency and the quality of what was previously a very fragmented service.49
  Currently in India, the state acts as purchaser, provider and regulator of a very small fraction of healthcare services. Within a UHC scheme using a PPS model, this would entail public trusts or other designated organizations receiving resources from mandatory social-health insurance and general taxation, and taking on the role of purchaser. Providers could be a mix of public and private accredited providers that compete for contracts and are paid based on a full capitation or a capitation plus Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) basis. The current set of tax-financed insurance schemes offer an opportunity for state governments to begin the process of creating autonomous purchasing agencies. These would not use insurance companies; instead, states would seek to build internal capabilities, much as Andhra Pradesh has done in the past for its Arogyasri programme. As the capabilities of an autonomous purchaser builds, a higher proportion of the health budget of the state could be channelled through these agencies to purchase healthcare from private and public providers. They could also then be well placed to offer health-insurance contracts that would become mandatory for the non-poor to purchase.
  The PPS model has a number of advantages. For example, it can address market imperfections due to information asymmetry in India, where the system does not enable patients to fully understand and properly evaluate the quality of advice and treatment that they receive, to determine if it is priced in a fair manner. Further, it can promote accountability and quality improvement as the purchaser has the responsibility of agreeing to certain quality-enhancing conditions through the negotiation, monitoring and review of the contract with the provider.50 A condition of obtaining and retaining a provider contract can be a ‘quality threshold’.51 Licensing (healthcare workers and facilities), certification (healthcare workers) and accreditation (healthcare facilities) can all be used by the purchaser to promote quality.52 So too can financial incentives. For example, meeting certain standards can be a prerequisite to payment (as is the case with payment to private providers from government Medicare and Medicaid in the US).53
Development of Integrated Provider Networks
Currently, patient care is highly fragmented and providers have few, if any, incentives to focus on patient well-being. Integrated networks of primary-care providers, paid on a per-patient (capitation) basis, can utilize the benefits of primary care to reduce hospitalization expenditures and offer every patient a continuum of care throughout their life. Several high-performing health systems, such as those in Thailand, the UK, Turkey and Brazil, have such features built into them.
  The government-owned health system in India operates in a fragmented manner and lacks the ability and autonomy to respond to financial incentives, such as capitated payments. Converting health departments into autonomous public-sector enterprises is worth exploring. In the private sector, although larger tertiary hospitals and several smaller secondary hospitals exist, no integrated provider has emerged. Instead of offering incentives for the creation of stand-alone private hospitals, the government could consider encouraging them to move to being integrated healthcare providers by providing them with preferential treatment when bidding for empanelment as providers. The insurance regulator could be persuaded to allow such integrated providers to combine financial protection and offer managed care contracts to individual and formal-sector clients.
Increased Use of Technology and Information
The use of technology in health in India is fragmented and inconsistent, often resulting in redundancies and unnecessary extra costs. A potential polio case is almost immediately identified using a complex information system, yet a large number of births and deaths still remain unregistered. Given India’s strong technological manpower, capacity to innovate, and the government’s current focus on technology, India is well placed to develop a nationwide information management system for healthcare.
  Thailand’s UHC scheme employs technology that links the unique identification number of each citizen to track entitlements, the utilization of services, and to ensure consistency of healthcare procedures across the country. The Taiwanese health system tracks each citizen’s healthcare status and consumption, with automatic alerts to patients and providers.
  Recognizing the importance of a comprehensive approach involving technology, the central government is now putting in place plans to create a National Electronic Health Management System—an interoperable patient-health record system accessible nationwide. Additionally, a National e-Health Authority is planned, to develop and regulate standards and compatibility for e-health systems. These are welcome initial steps, but there is a long journey ahead to achieve the desired level of maturity in the use of technology in the healthcare sector.
Optimal Use of Human Resources for Health
India requires the right mix of workforce expertise to tackle absenteeism of doctors and medical-service providers, which can be nearly 40 per cent,54 and address the gaps in the provision of qualified healthcare staff, particularly in rural areas. The growing disease burden arising from NCDs, and advancements in medicine have also meant an increased need for surgeons and other specialists at the district level.
  Several solutions exist. The rapid ‘upskilling’ of district-level doctors through a training and certification programme at accredited local hospitals would improve the supply of specialist services at the district level.55 Maintaining live registries on the supply and mix of health workers, and separating this data at the district level would make a big difference to workforce planning and management.56 Technology has proven to be an effective instrument to better employ human resources and introduce workforce accountability.
Conclusion
India has made notable progress in health outcomes since 1991. Today, a child is almost three times less likely to die before completing five years of life, and a mother is half as likely to die while giving birth, than in 1990.57 Despite these improvements, the achievements of other countries show us that India could have done more with its available resources. The interstate analysis in this chapter further presents a cautionary tale of health systems, which lack intentional design.
  The experience of the twenty-five years since reforms demonstrates that leaving the provision of healthcare to the invisible hand of the market is not the solution to achieving better health outcomes. The current system has been unable to resolve a number of distortions in healthcare, such as high price elasticity at the primary-care level and the unpredictability of healthcare costs. This makes an idealized view of the market difficult, and makes a strong case for active government intervention in this sector.
  In all high-performing healthcare systems, governments act purposefully to finance, plan and deliver the required services. In comparing India’s progress with other countries, particularly those who have achieved or are on their way to UHC, we find that there is more India could have done with its finances. The solution is not one of simply spending more. If India is to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal of UHC, the government must strategically consider some basic, yet transformative, design reforms to improve how it finances, plans, delivers and regulates healthcare services.

THE FINANCIAL SECTOR: AN OPPORTUNITY FOR INNOVATION AND GROWTH
 
 
21
Reforms and the Transformation of the Monetary and Banking Sectors
C. Rangarajan
If growth is to be achieved with stability, much depends on how monetary policy is operated. Results depend on the sagacity and wisdom of the policymakers. The external sector went through a complete regime change. Financial-sector reforms have been gradual but substantial. It has been done in a way that it did not disrupt the system.
In the post-Independence economic history of the country, 1991 marks an important watershed. The country then faced a severe economic crisis, triggered largely by an acute balance-of-payments problem. The response to the crisis was to put in place a set of policies aimed at stabilization and structural reform. While the stabilization policies were designed at correcting weaknesses that had developed on the fiscal and balance-of-payment fronts, the structural reforms were meant to remove the rigidities that had entered the various segments of the Indian economy and to make the system more competitive and efficient. Thus the crisis was turned into an opportunity to effect some fundamental changes in the content and approach to economic policy, resulting in a paradigm shift.
  This break with the past came in three important directions. The first was to dismantle the complex regime of licences, permits and controls that dictated almost every facet of production and distribution. Barriers to entry and growth were removed. The second change in direction was to reverse the strong bias towards state ownership of means of production and proliferation of public-sector enterprises in almost every sphere of economic activity. Areas once reserved exclusively for the state were thrown open to private enterprise. The third change in direction was to abandon the inward-looking trade policy. By embracing international trade, India signalled that it was boldly abandoning its export pessimism and was accepting the challenge and opportunity of integrating into the world economy.
  Even as reforms were introduced in the real sector, it became obvious that without corresponding reforms in the financial sector, the expected results would not be achieved. In this article, we propose to outline the key changes that occurred in the monetary and banking sectors. We also examine the changes in relation to the exchange-rate regime, which was part of the external-sector reforms. In Section I, a brief review of the developments in the three sectors in the 1980s is given. Section II outlines in some detail the measures introduced in the first few years after the launch of the reforms. Section III is devoted to the developments over the last decade and a half. Section IV provides an assessment.
I. Developments in the 1980s
Developments in the monetary and banking sectors in the 1980s were a prelude to the reforms that happened post 1991. They were in the same direction but were not as fundamental as the 1991 reforms. In the monetary sector, the 1980s saw a shift in focus. Prior to 1982, the emphasis was on the quantum of credit and its allocation. In the 1980s, attention shifted to larger aggregates such as money supply. The quantum of credit and its allocation became part of an overall picture. It was realized that inflation control required regulation of money supply and the regulation of money supply, in turn, required an understanding with the government on the quantum of government borrowing and its monetization. The Chakravarty Committee, which reported in 1985, outlined an approach to money-supply growth. The targeted growth rate in money supply was related to the expected increase in real income and the acceptable level of inflation. Obviously, such an approach rested on a stable-demand function for money and, therefore, on a reasonably constant income elasticity of demand for money. This approach, which was accepted, could broadly be described as ‘flexible monetary targeting’. The Chakravarty Committee assumed that the administered structure of interest rates would continue. However, it outlined some principles on the basis of which the deposit rates and consequently the lending rates could be prescribed. In fact, a very serious attempt was made to reduce the complex structure of the administered interest rates. By September 1990, the number of prescribed slabs was drastically reduced. The decade also saw the introduction of a number of money-market instruments and the menu of financial products available expanded.
  In the banking sector, while broadly the structure remained the same, there was an attempt to look at the quality of assets and classify them based on quality. Attempts were also made to streamline the administration of priority-sector credit. Computerization of the banking operations made its beginning.
  With respect to exchange-rate management, the system continued to remain the same as it was in the beginning of the 1980s and that was to relate the rate to a basket of currencies with a band. However, two important changes occurred. The adjustment of exchange rate was frequent and an attempt was made to ensure that the exchange rate of the rupee in real terms did not appreciate. Thus the nominal value of the rupee depreciated significantly in view of the higher level of inflation in India. Second, in order to assess the value of the rupee, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for the first time computed the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) and the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER).
II. Reforms between 1991–1997
Monetary Sector Reforms
The institutional framework within which monetary policy operated underwent several changes. The most important change was the phasing out of the system of the issue of ad hoc treasury bills by the government to the RBI. Under that system, whenever the cash balances of the Government of India fell below a particular level, it could issue these ad hoc treasury bills and replenish its cash balances. This innocuous arrangement had the effect of automatically monetizing the fiscal deficit of the central government. Under such an arrangement, the RBI virtually lost control over the regulation of money supply. The fiscal dominance was complete. I had argued even prior to 1991 to do away with this system. As governor, I pressed the finance minister to make this change and he readily agreed. This may indeed be considered as the first step towards giving autonomy to the RBI in relation to the conduct of monetary policy. This was followed up later when the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003, put an end to the RBI entering the primary market in government securities. These are essential reforms to enable the RBI to regulate liquidity in the system according to its judgement. Coupled with the decision to phase out the system of ad hoc treasury bills was the decision to compel the government to go to the market and raise funds at market-determined rates. The statutory liquidity ratio, which is the proportion of deposits to be kept by banks in the form of government securities, was also brought down steadily from 38.5 per cent in 1991 to 25 per cent by 1996. As a consequence, an elaborate system for auctioning of government bonds of various maturities had to be put in place. The system of primary dealers in government securities was also introduced. The most important consequence of this move for monetary policy was that open-market operations emerged for the first time as an instrument of monetary control. So long as rates of interest on government bonds were artificially fixed, there was no scope for open-market operations to be used as an instrument of credit control. Under those circumstances, the cash-reserve ratio became the primary instrument of credit control. Yet another change was the dismantling of the administered structure of interest rates. With the freeing of the interest-rate structure, the bank rate also became a potential instrument of credit control. If today we are able to talk in terms of the repo rate, which is only a cousin of bank rate as a signal rate, the foundation for that was laid in the early years of the reform period. There is a continuing debate on what the objectives of monetary policy should be. However, the instrumental freedom which is necessary for the conduct of monetary policy was achieved in the early years of the reform process.
Banking Sector Reforms
The Indian banking system, as it was in 1990, was dominated by two features. First, the public sector accounted for the bulk of the banking assets. Second, it operated under a heavily controlled regime. It had evolved in an environment of administered interest rates and stipulations on asset allocation. Growth of the banking system during the first two decades after the nationalization of banks in 1969 was marked by a spectacular spread of banking with an increase in the number of branches from 8187 in 1969 to 59,752 at the end of March 1990. The growth of rural branches was even faster, increasing from 1443 in 1969 to 34,791 as at the end of March 1990. While the banking sector widened its reach, its own health had got impaired. Low operational efficiency contributed to low profitability and consequently to erosion of its capital base. There was therefore an urgent need to address the issue and the move towards reforms was a natural corollary. A committee was set up under the chairmanship of M. Narasimham which had recommended the steps to be taken to revitalize the banking system. A set of prudential norms relating to income recognition, asset classification, provisioning and capital adequacy were introduced. Prudential and capital-adequacy norms were prescribed to ensure the safety and soundness of the system. In line with international standards, the public-sector banks were required to progressively achieve a capital to risk assets ratio of 8 per cent. A frequently asked question at that time was since these banks were owned by government, whether there was a need to prescribe norms such as the capital-adequacy ratio. Prudential norms are required to make the system stand on its own strength. The imposition of the capital-adequacy norms required the government, which owned the public-sector banks, to contribute to capital in order to reach the prescribed ratio. This was indeed a difficult task at a time when the government as part of its fiscal-policy reforms was trying to contain fiscal deficit. But the government did not flinch and for over several years, it continued to contribute to the capital of the public-sector banks. The term ‘non-performing assets’ was unknown in India till 1991. The RBI progressively tightened the definition of what constitutes a non-performing asset.
  Three other important changes in relation to the banking system must also be noted. First, the Nationalization Act was amended to enable the government to reduce its share of holding in the public-sector banks to 51 per cent. This was indeed a difficult legislation. The members of the Congress party had a sentimental attachment to the nationalization of banks. However, the public character of the institutions was maintained as the majority holding was still in the hands of the government. But the induction of the private sector into the ownership structure had its own effect in terms of performance. Second, reforms in the banking sector would not be of any avail unless the administered structure of interest rates was dismantled. With interest rates stipulated by the RBI, there was hardly any competition. But the dismantling had to be done in a measured way so that banks could get adjusted to the new regime. It took almost two to three years before we could move to a system in which the banks had the freedom to determine the deposit and lending rates. Third, in order to create a more competitive environment in the banking system, after several decades, licences were granted to the private sector to open new banks, with new norms set for the opening of banks. Initially, long-term lending institutions that were already in existence were given licences to open banks.
  The introduction of prudential norms did create an uncomfortable situation for the banks. Several of the public-sector banks had to show losses. This was indeed a traumatic experience. As the reforms were introduced, profitability and efficiency increased and the non-performing-asset ratio progressively came down. Care was taken to ensure that the social content of lending was not reduced. The Indian banking system has emerged considerably stronger because of the changes introduced.
External Sector Reforms
The external sector went through a complete regime change. This is to be expected since the crisis itself was triggered by an acute balance-of-payments problem. The reform of the external sector comprised two elements. The first related to changes in the trade sector. Quantitative controls over imports were being removed step by step. The tariff rates were also brought down steadily from the high levels at which they stood at that time. The changes in the trade sector signalled the movement away from an inward-looking approach to the adoption of an open policy of integrating with the rest of the world. The second element in the external-sector reforms related to the changes in exchange-rate management. The steep devaluation effected in early July 1991 was followed by the introduction of the exim scrip scheme which enabled exporters to import a certain percentage of their export earnings without restrictions. This effectively meant a selective devaluation. In 1991, the government appointed a High Level Committee on Balance of Payments under my chairmanship to look at the capital account of India’s balance of payments. Apart from recommendations relating to the management of capital account, the committee also made key recommendations with respect to exchange rate. Based on the recommendations of the interim report of this committee and other inputs, the government and the RBI moved to a dual exchange-rate system in March 1992. Until that time, the exchange value of the rupee was determined by the RBI every day. Under the new system, 40 per cent of the current receipts were required to be surrendered to the RBI at an official exchange rate while the rest was allowed to be sold at the market-determined exchange rate. The high-level committee in its final report recommended the adoption of a unified market-determined exchange-rate system. In fact, the experience with the dual exchange-rate system provided courage to move to a full-fledged market-determined exchange-rate system. Under the dual exchange-rate system, while the official rate continued to be Rs 25.80 per dollar, the market rate ranged between Rs 30 to Rs 31.50 per dollar. In March 1993, we moved to a unified market-determined exchange-rate system. In fact, the transition was smoother than expected. Though the rupee weakened a bit immediately after the Budget, subsequently the rupee strengthened and a remarkable stability was seen in the behaviour of the exchange rate which remained steady at the level of Rs 31.37 against the US dollar for a long period. This new system that was introduced did not preclude intervention by the RBI. In the context of the reasonably good capital flows, the value of the rupee remained stable because of the intervention of the RBI in the market which resulted in the accumulation of foreign-exchange reserves. There was a compelling necessity at that time to raise the level of the reserves. The RBI from time to time has clarified its position regarding the policy of intervention. Post 1992-93, it must be said that the balance-of-payments position of India has remained strong, unlike what it used to be prior to 1991. Though the system that was adopted is described as ‘managed float’, it nevertheless remains mostly determined by the demand and supply of foreign exchange. The Indian rupee became convertible on the current account in 1994.
III. Post-1997 Developments
Monetary Sector
With major institutional reforms having been effected by 1997, the main focus after that was on policy. However, there have been two significant institutional changes that need to be noted.
  First, the introduction of the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF), besides providing a mechanism for dealing with the short-term surplus or deficit of funds faced by commercial banks, also established the repo rate as a policy rate. This again was possible only because the administered structure of interest had been done away with earlier. Though interest rate (as distinct from money supply) has emerged as the signal of the central bank, it must be emphasized that any decision of the RBI to raise or lower the repo rate must be accompanied by actions which result in reducing or expanding liquidity. In short, the RBI cannot act as King Canute. It cannot simply order interest rates. It must take such actions as are necessary to make the decision stick.
  Second is the most recent change to introduce a new monetary policy framework. Under the new framework which has a legal sanction, the RBI is expected to maintain the consumer price index (CPI) inflation at 4 per cent with a margin of (+) or (-) 2 per cent. A monetary policy committee has also been set up with three nominees each from the RBI and the government. The decision of the committee is binding. The governor has a casting vote in case of a tie. Inflation-targeting as the objective of monetary policy has strong adherents as well as detractors. The new framework is however a firm assertion of the maintenance of price stability as the dominant objective of monetary policy.
Banking Sector Reforms
The structural reforms in the banking sector introduced in the initial years were further strengthened. The prudential norms have been tightened and altered in the context of changing circumstances. We have moved from Basel I norms to Basel II and now to Basel III norms. After the financial crisis of 2008, the need to curb excessive risk-taking by banks has become essential. The RBI brings out at periodic intervals Financial Stability Reports assessing the vulnerability of the banking system to various shocks. The problem of non-performing assets has once again reared its head. The prudential norms only make transparent the health of the banks. It is up to individual banks and the regulator to take appropriate action to improve the situation.
  After the initial burst of licensing the private-sector banks, there was a lull. However, most recently, a new policy framework with respect to the licensing of banks has come into operation. The issue of new licences is being put on tap. The new policy relates not just to large banks but also envisages the setting up of small banks as well as of payment banks which do not have the power to lend. The concept of small banks is a modification of the earlier idea of Local Area Banks introduced in 1996. Under the new concept, there is, however, no limit on territorial jurisdiction. The payment banks concept is a new one. These banks are allowed to take the savings deposits and offer facilities for the transfer of funds. While they can invest the funds in government paper, they cannot lend. The new scheme is just taking off.
  There is a growing emphasis on financial inclusion. The objective is to bring within the ambit of the organized financial system the vulnerable and the poor. The poor and the low-income groups have been encouraged to open bank accounts and an attempt is also being made to link these bank accounts with various poverty-reduction schemes such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. The payments to the beneficiaries are directly made into their bank accounts.
  The Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) were loosely regulated prior to 1996. That is how the law stood at that time. Post-1997, more stringent norms have been specified. Particularly, NBFCs which take public deposits have come under stringent scrutiny.
Exchange-rate Reforms
The development of the foreign-exchange market became a major concern once the exchange rate came to be determined largely by the market. The RBI has taken several actions that are necessary to strengthen the spot and future markets. It also became obvious that the foreign-exchange market and the domestic money market were organically related.
  The Indian economy has faced many external shocks since 1997. First was the East Asian crisis. Second was the impact of the Pokhran nuclear explosion. Third was the 2008 financial crisis and the fourth the 2013 taper tantrums. With deft policy changes, all these were handled well. We could do this with our own resources and without having to go to any international organization. In fact, as mentioned earlier, India’s balance-of-payments situation has never remained as strong as it has been since 1992–93.
  Capital-account convertibility has proceeded gradually. There is now much greater freedom to transfer funds on the capital account. However, it is well recognized that regulation of capital movements must remain a necessary part of the policy framework. Capital controls may be needed not only in times of crisis but also in situations where a crisis is looming on the horizon.
  With the acceptance of current-account convertibility and with greater freedom on capital account, the erstwhile Foreign Exchange Regulation Act had become inconsistent. A new Act was in preparation even before 1997. It became law subsequently and the new Foreign Exchange Management Act was passed in 1999.
IV. An Assessment
The reforms in the monetary sector have been in the right direction. The two big changes—phasing out the system of ad hoc treasury bills and the new monetary policy framework—have made the monetary authority more autonomous and accountable. Monetary policy has emerged as an independent tool of economic policy. If growth is to be achieved with stability, much depends on how monetary policy is operated. The institutional freedom is now available. Results depend on the sagacity and wisdom of policymakers. Regarding the new monetary policy framework, one misgiving needs to be dispelled. Inflation-targeting, it is argued, precludes monetary authorities from paying attention to other objectives. This is a wrong interpretation. So long as inflation remains within the comfort zone, the monetary authority must and can take care of other objectives. It is only when inflation goes above the limit and it is feared that this will persist that the exclusive concern of the authority becomes inflation control. Some critics point out that inflation-targeting has not prevented the financial crisis of 2008. Hence, again one saw a wrong application of the concept. Even if inflation is within the acceptable range and if for other reasons interest rate should be increased, it should be done. It is here that the monetary authorities in the West failed.
  As far as financial-sector reforms are concerned, two questions arise. One is whether the reforms have been taken to the logical end and what is the unfinished agenda. The second relates to the efficiency-impact of the reforms. Financial-sector reforms have been gradual but substantial. They have been done in a way that they did not disrupt the system. Banking-sector reforms have gone hand in hand with capital-market reforms. In terms of reforms, two issues remain to be resolved. The first concerns public-sector banks. State-owned banks still dominate the banking scene, even though their share is coming down. The amendment to the Nationalization Act has allowed private-sector participation up to 49 per cent. Do we need all these state-owned banks or can we reduce the number and let, at least in the case of some banks, private-sector participation go beyond 50 per cent? These are not strictly economic issues. Given the fact that public-sector banks will continue to dominate the banking sector, what are the reforms that are needed to make them independent of political influence and at the same time accountable? Very little progress has been made in this area despite several committees reporting on it.
  The second issue relating to financial-sector reforms is whether a common legislation for the entire financial sector, as recommended by the Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission, is needed. There is no doubt that all regulators, whether of banks or capital markets or insurance companies, must follow certain common standards. It is accepted that customer protection is a key requirement. However, there is a difference of opinion on whether there should be a single omnibus legislation or whether there can be separate legislations for different regulators accompanied by one legislation laying down certain common principles, including judicial review of the regulators’ action. The latter approach seems easier to achieve.
  On the efficiency-impact of reforms, it has to be noted that the primary purpose of banking-sector reforms was to make the banking system sound and safe while serving as an instrument of growth by providing credit. The discipline of prudential norms had a highly beneficial impact. As noted earlier, the ratio of non-performing loans steadily came down. However, there has been a sharp rise in the last three years. The slowdown in growth is an important factor. The optimistic assumptions made during the phase of high growth have been belied. The exposure to sectors which are vulnerable to the macro environment has been high. Even as attempts are made to clean up the balance sheets of banks, there has to be a rethink on our prudential regulations, particularly macro prudential norms and our regulatory apparatus.
  In conclusion, one broader issue involving the relationship between innovation and regulation needs to be kept in mind. Banking development has taken big strides in the last two decades. A question that is being asked increasingly is whether the financial sector today is inherently more volatile and vulnerable than before. The very factors that have contributed to the growth of the financial sector may well have contributed to increased fragility. Close interdependence among markets and market participants has increased the potential of adverse events to spread quickly. It has significantly increased the scope and speed of contagion. Some question whether the new financial products serve any socially useful purpose. It has been argued that much of the recent innovation in the financial system has sought to increase the short-term profitability of the financial sector rather than increase the ability of financial markets to better perform their essential functions of managing risks and allocating capital. It would be inappropriate to classify all or even most of the financial innovations introduced in the last few decades as socially useless. Many of the financial products satisfy a felt need. There is no argument that the regulatory regime needs to be structured to make the banking system sound. Excessive risk-taking and leveraging by banks need to be discouraged with appropriate regulatory measures or controls. In developing economies like India, the structure of the economy is undergoing a rapid change. The financial system must be able to meet the diversified needs of a growing economy. In this context, we must actually encourage financial innovations. Too little regulation may lead to financial instability but too much of it can impede financial innovations which are badly needed. The policymakers must strike an appropriate balance between the need for financial innovations to promote growth and the need for regulation to ensure stability.

Liberalizing Indian Capital Markets: Highly Successful Reforms and an Unfinished Agenda
Jaimini Bhagwati1
Wonders if adequate attention has been paid to auditing and accounting integrity, despite several examples of periodic and systematic wrongdoings. In retrospect, a calibrated approach to liberalizing capital markets was appropriate in the early 1990s since it takes time to build regulatory expertise. SEBI needs to continually improve its surveillance capabilities in even closer coordination with the other financial-sector regulators.
Background
The catalytic intermediary role of an efficient financial sector in promoting innovative growth is accepted internationally. The interdependence of the four segments of the financial sector—banking, capital markets, insurance and pensions—is also well acknowledged. Capital markets are the dominant providers of financing in the US, while in Europe, banks are the principal intermediaries of capital. Banks and non-finance banking companies (NBFCs) continue to be the major source of financing in India. Public-sector banks still account for over 70 per cent of deposits in the banking sector. Although there are a number of private insurance companies, the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), which is government-owned, is the largest player in the insurance space. Among pension providers, government and public provident funds are dominant.
  In contrast, Indian capital markets are the most penetrated by private-sector market-makers and participants. Due to the reforms initiated in the early 1990s, Indian equity markets—spot and exchange-traded derivatives—are relatively ahead in transparency and pricing efficiency. In the banking, insurance and pension sub-sectors, there is inadequate competition as the majority government-owned institutions are the market leaders.
  In the first four decades post-Independence, Indian capital markets consisted essentially of stocks and government debt securities. That is, till the late 1980s, the capital-market segments consisted of: (a) listed equities that were traded principally on just one stock exchange, namely the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE); (b) central and state government debt securities, issued at administered interest rates rather than through auctions and; (c) mostly private and limited public placements of equity and corporate debt. The Controller of Capital Issues (CCI) in the Ministry of Finance decided on the quantum, pricing and timing of the corporate sector’s issuance of both equity and debt through initial public offerings. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) managed the issuance of central-government debt and was the fallback purchaser of these securities.
  Since the 1990s, government debt has been auctioned and primary dealers bid for these securities to try and arrive at market-determined interest rates. However, small-scale savings and the amounts managed by the Employees’ Provident Fund Organization and other provident funds are still at administered interest rates. Plus, an array of schemes for agriculture and small-scale sectors receive credit at subsidized interest rates.
  The mutual fund industry was initiated with the establishment of the UTI mutual fund under the Unit Trust of India Act passed in 1964. The UTI mutual fund continued to be the largest till the 1990s. In 1988, the government set up the capital markets regulator called the Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI) under an administrative order.
  Section I of this review of capital-market reforms in the last twenty-five years details the most significant steps taken by the government and SEBI. This section includes the setting up and strengthening of market-infrastructure institutions such as stock exchanges, depositories and clearing corporations, which led to enhanced competition. Section II explains the development and continuing shortcomings of the sub-segments of Indian capital markets, i.e., equity, debt and derivatives markets and institutional participants such as mutual funds and foreign institutional investors (FIIs). Section III covers overarching issues of market integrity, coordination across regulators, accounting oversight and systemic risk. The last and concluding Section IV lists what has been achieved and what remains to be done.
Section I
1. Game-changing Reforms
1.1. Capital Markets Regulator: SEBI
From 1991–96, significant economic reforms were initiated by the Narasimha Rao government. This was also the period for a wave of improvements in the regulation of capital markets and its infrastructure with the overall objective of minimizing liquidity, solvency and operational risks.
  One of the most significant reforms was the passing of the SEBI Act in 1992 to set up a statute-based capital markets regulator. The 1993–94 Budget speech mentioned that the government was ‘vigorously pursuing reforms in the capital markets’. Further, it stated that SEBI ‘which was given statutory status and powers . . . has been entrusted with bringing about this transition . . . the office of the CCI in the Ministry of Finance has been abolished and almost all powers under the Securities Contract (Regulation) Act2 have been delegated or transferred to SEBI’.
1.2. Market Infrastructure Institutions (MIIs)
STOCK EXCHANGES
Another game-changing reform was the setting up of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) in 1993. In the early 1990s, the central government was concerned about BSE’s monopoly in stock trading and its resistance to demutualization.3 Accordingly, the NSE was set up and its principal public-sector shareholders were LIC, State Bank of India (SBI), IFCI and Stock Holding Corporation of India. In April 1993, NSE was recognized as the first demutualized exchange in India under the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act. Transactions in equities and wholesale debt markets started on NSE in November 1994. Since its inception, NSE’s order booking system was based on electronic matching of buy–sell orders instead of open outcry, which incidentally was the practice at that time in stock exchanges in developed countries. NSE went on to have a significant role in developing equity, debt and derivatives markets.
DEPOSITORIES AND CLEARING CORPORATIONS
It was widely recognized well before the 1990s that paper-based trading of stocks led to ‘bad’ and delayed deliveries of titles. Consequently, the Depositories Act was passed in May 1996. The National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) was set up by IDBI, UTI and NSE in November 1996. Securities (shares, bonds and debentures) could then be held in individual or institutional accounts and transferred, and dividends received without hard copies being signed and exchanged. Subsequently, the Central Depository Services Limited was set up by BSE in 1999. Currently, the settlement time and transaction costs in Indian stock exchanges are similar to those in developed countries. Table 1 provides the details of the steady increase in dematerialized volumes since 1996–97.
 
  Table 1: Growth in Dematerialized Stock Volumes
 
Source: SEBI.
The National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCCL) is a fully owned subsidiary of NSE. NSCCL started operations in April 1996 as India’s first clearing corporation and it introduced settlement and counter-party risk guarantees. RBI has traditionally been circumspect about Indian stock-exchange brokers and does not trust them to transparently manage trading in instruments that have a bearing on rupee interest or exchange rates. This was perhaps the principal motivating factor in RBI’s decision to set up the Clearing Corporation of India (CCIL). CCIL settles trades in government debt securities consisting of outright and repo transactions that are reported in RBI’s Negotiated Dealing System (NDS). CCIL is aimed at settling all trades that deal with interest and exchange rate over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. Central banks around the world are usually not involved in setting up clearing corporations. RBI, as a financial-sector regulator, should distance itself from CCIL, which is an MII.
  Stock exchanges in several developed countries are listed and this practice is cited as an example for Indian stock exchanges to follow. Stock Exchanges, Depositories and Clearing Corporations were categorized as MIIs in the Bimal Jalan Committee report,4 which stated that it was ‘not in favour of permitting listing of MIIs’. MIIs, including stock exchanges, have surveillance responsibilities. It follows that profit maximization should not be part of the mandate of MIIs, and they should not be listed.
Section II
1. Equity Markets
In the early 1990s, BSE had the overwhelming share of trading turnover. However, NSE quickly overtook BSE and the margin widened over time as is evident from the numbers in Table 2.
 
  Table 2: Equity Market Trading Turnover
 
Source: NSE and BSE.
LIC is one of the largest holders of stocks among institutional investors. The timing of LIC’s purchases and sales of key equity index stocks appears to indicate that it usually works with the government to ‘stabilize’ markets. Equity markets need to be weaned off any dependence on LIC, whose principal objective should be to broaden its reach in insurance markets.
  Table 3 details equity-market capitalization and trading turnover in several countries. Stock-market capitalization, as a percentage of GDP, has grown substantially in India since 1991. Capitalization varies with movements in stock prices and growth in GDP. At the height of the financial-sector excesses in 2006–07, prior to the 2008 crash, the value of Indian stocks rose briefly to 147 per cent of GDP.

In the last few years, fresh investment in India has been inhibited as large borrowers have struggled to service their debts. The companies that are continuing to do well are relatively cash rich and their promoters do not want to dilute their equity holdings. As a result, as seen in Table 4, the volumes of public and rights issues of equity have shrunk since 2010–11.

As of 2015, 46 per cent of the market value of Indian stocks was held by domestic and another 5 per cent by foreign promoters. Of the remaining free float of 49 per cent, about 20 per cent was held by FIIs, 16 per cent by retail investors, 12 per cent by domestic institutional investors such as insurance companies (mainly LIC) and mutual funds.
1.1. Private Equity and Venture Capital
Indian private equity and venture capital (VC) markets have developed substantially in the last fifteen years. Global private-equity flows did slow down after 2008 but have picked up again in the last few years. Private-equity investments in 2014 saw a robust increase over 2013. Deal value, including real estate, infrastructure and VC, increased to $15.2 billion, inching closer to the pre-crisis 2007 peak level of $17.1 billion.5
2. Debt Markets
2.1. Central Government Debt
Indian debt markets are dominated by government-fixed income securities. The outstanding stocks of central-government securities are shown in Table 5. Once government decides on its requirements of funds for the financial year, RBI manages debt issuance across the desired maturity buckets.
 
  Table 5: Outstanding Liabilities of Central Government (Per Cent of GDP)
 
Source: RBI.
Table 5 also lists central-government borrowings at non-market interest rates through small savings schemes, provident funds and deposits. The stock of managed interest rate borrowings amounted to 10.2 per cent of GDP in 2015–16 as compared to 39 per cent for borrowings based on market-interest rates.
  Over the last two decades, markets for central-government debt securities have increased in liquidity and sophistication. For example, floating-interest rate, zero coupon and inflation-linked bonds have been issued, and repo markets involving government securities are liquid.
  The central government has consciously chosen not to borrow in hard currencies through bond offerings. The unstated concern is that this may lead to borrowings in foreign exchange (FX) reaching unsustainable levels. FIIs are allowed to invest in government debt up to a ceiling of $50 billion. The reasoning for this ceiling is that if the volumes of such investments reach high levels, it may become difficult, at times of balance-of-payments stress, to service interest and principal redemption in FX. In August–September 2013, at the time of the ‘taper tantrum’, there were substantial FX outflows mostly due to redemption of FII investments in government debt securities.
  The Indian Constitution does not allow state governments to borrow directly in hard currency. All their borrowings from private or multilateral agencies such as the World Bank have to be routed through the central government.
2.2. Corporate Bond Market
Table 6 shows that even if corporate-debt volumes are taken into account, Indian debt markets are smaller and consequently less liquid than comparable markets in the US, Japan and Germany. Developed-country bond markets facilitate raising of funds at competitive interest rates as compared to syndicated bank loans.6 Further, liquid bonds can be used to reduce duration mismatch risk between assets and liabilities.7

Short-selling of government securities is not allowed. Consequently, the government-yield curve is not arbitrage-free. That is, interest rates across the maturity spectrum are not consistent with each other. It follows that this makes pricing of corporate creditworthiness of the government-yield curve, which is also inadequately liquid at longer maturities, less accurate. A mitigating factor is that CRISIL and ICRA, two major Indian credit-rating agencies, have created a better appreciation of credit risk across corporate-debt issuers.
  Large and profitable Indian corporations with a proven track record are able to issue bonds in FX or access funds through external commercial borrowings. The other options for credit-worthy corporates are public offerings or private placements of equity. As a result, there is relatively limited issuance of bonds by higher credit-rated Indian firms.
  Another reason for the underdeveloped state of the Indian corporate bond market is the lack of liquid secondary markets. In this context, long-term institutional investors, particularly pension funds and insurance companies, are restrained by regulator-prescribed guidelines from investing in corporate bonds.
  Historically, Indian courts have sided with debtors against creditors on the grounds that this may lead to workers losing employment. The Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act of 2002 and Debt Recovery Tribunals were expected to address this bias against creditors. However, this did not happen due to the interminable delays in the working of the Bureau of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) which was finally abolished on 1 December 2016.9 In July 2016, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Act was passed by Parliament. Although it will take time for this legislation to be put into effect, this law should make it easier for creditors to stake their claims against debtors.
  In the Budget speech of 2016–2017, the government announced measures to deepen the corporate bond market.10 The report of the H.R. Khan ‘Working Group on Development of the Corporate Bond Market in India’ was issued in August 2016. RBI has been asked to encourage large corporate borrowers to access bond markets rather than banks and also create an electronic platform to facilitate a repo market in corporate bonds. However, lenders will continue to be watchful of the creditworthiness of corporate borrowers and the efficacy of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Act. LIC has been directed to set up a separate fund to raise the creditworthiness of infrastructure projects. This could become an unwarranted subsidy for corporate borrowers. It is perceived high-credit risk that is the single-most important factor holding back further development of this segment of fixed-income markets in India. Consequently, the legal balance that is lopsided in favour of debtors needs to be corrected.
MUNICIPAL BONDS
The Bangalore Municipal Corporation was the first to raise Rs 125 crore in 1997 by issuing bonds with a state government guarantee. In 1998, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation issued bonds without a government guarantee. In aggregate, Rs 1353 crore worth of bonds have been issued under tax-free, taxable and pooled municipal bond schemes. There is hardly any secondary market for these bonds.
  Indian municipal bond markets are underdeveloped compared to developed country jurisdictions such as the US where the size of the municipal bond market is estimated at $3 trillion. This is principally because of the lack of qualified personnel in Indian municipalities. Additionally, the perception is that municipal revenues cannot be reliably estimated or escrowed. Potential investors in long maturity municipal bonds have to be reassured by ring-fencing municipal income to address the perceived high-credit risk in investing in such bonds. In September 2016, credit ratings were assigned to twelve India cities (urban local bodies), and this may facilitate municipal bond issuance.
ASSET BACKED SECURITIES (ABSS)
The need for housing finance in India far outstrips supply. In developed countries, providers of housing finance reduce risk on their balance sheets by issuing mortgage-backed securities. Table 7 shows that as of 2015, issuance of ABSs in India was relatively small. If credit ratings are prudent, ABSs help to improve the efficiency with which capital is allocated. In India, the legal framework for ABSs is provided by the SARFAESI Act. The application of this legislation is perceived as inadequately protective of creditor rights.

2.3. Pension and Insurance Sectors
The sub-sectors of banking, capital markets, pension and insurance feed into each other. The development of capital markets and particularly bond markets depends on the growth of insurance and pension coverage. Tables 8 and 9 show that the insurance and pension markets are still small in India. It follows that further growth of these two sub-sectors would help in the development of Indian capital markets.
 
  Table 8: Insurance Assets (Per Cent of GDP)
 
Source: World Bank.
 
  Table 9: Pension Fund Assets (Per Cent of GDP)
 
Source: World Bank.
The guidelines of the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) stipulate that for investments under the National Pension Scheme (NPS), debt securities are favoured over equity. Further, the overriding concern is about creditworthiness of issuers of debt and hence government securities are preferred.11 Similarly, the investment norms prescribed by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) state that at least 50 per cent of investments have to be in government or similar securities. Additionally, 75 per cent of investments in debt instruments have to be sovereign bonds, AAA rated or equivalent. Consequently, the norms for pension and insurance funds do not allow investment in most Indian corporate bonds since these are rated below AAA.
2.4. Derivatives
OTC AND EXCHANGE-TRADED DERIVATIVES
Interest rate and currency swap OTC derivatives were introduced by RBI in the late 1990s. Subsequently, in 2001, at the initiative of the Ministry of Finance, the Securities and Contract (Regulation) Act was amended to include derivatives in the definition of securities. This enabled trading in exchange-traded derivatives beginning with stock futures and options, interest-rate futures in 2003, and currency futures in 2008. The underlying ‘security’ on which exchange-traded and OTC derivatives are marketed include stock, commodity and bond prices as also interest and exchange rates. The maturities of OTC derivatives in Indian markets have been lengthening, but are still way short of those in the developed markets. This is principally because the rupee is not convertible on the capital account and, hence, these markets are limited by the width and depth of the Indian financial markets.
  The considerable increase in the outstanding principal volumes of exchange-traded derivatives (also called ‘open interest’) on NSE is evident from the numbers in Table 10. The number of contracts has increased by a factor of thirty and the notional principal has risen by more than twenty times between 2004 and 2015. One of the principal benefits is that it is now difficult, compared to the pre-derivatives era before 2002, to manipulate stock prices. If stock prices are artificially raised, asset-management firms or individuals would spot the opportunity for profits and take short positions in the futures/options markets, thus bringing down stock prices to realistic levels.

COMMODITY DERIVATIVES
In India, commodity derivatives12 used to be regulated by the Forward Markets Commission (FMC) and the administrative Ministry for Food and Civil Supplies. The logic was that this ministry was in a better position to oversee derivative markets in the prices of agricultural and other commodities. Given the suspicion that traders had hoarded ‘dal’ (pulses), rice and wheat, the trading of commodity derivatives in these products was suspended in 2007. Later in 2008, trading in commodity derivatives related to the prices of rubber, potato, chickpeas and soya oil was stopped. There have been instances of fraud in commodity futures as in the 2013 Jignesh Shah-led National Spot Exchange Limited scam. However, gradually there is greater understanding about commodity derivatives in Indian government and regulatory circles. In a widely acclaimed move to reduce regulatory arbitrage, the FMC was folded into SEBI at end of September 2015. Currently, SEBI allows trading of futures contracts on prices of agricultural items, metals and energy products.
CREDIT DERIVATIVES
Market makers in credit derivatives segregate credit risk and effectively offer insurance for the risk, e.g. that a bond issuer may default. Credit Default Swaps (CDSs) was the credit-derivative instrument of choice before 2008. Around 2006, according to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, the notional principal of credit derivatives was about $34 trillion. It should have been evident to regulators in the US that insurance market makers such as AIG were inadequately capitalized for the volumes of credit derivatives that they were underwriting. The Financial Stability Board based in Basel has recommended that credit derivatives be traded on exchanges rather than tailor-made as OTC derivatives. The supporting logic is that margins would have to be posted on a daily basis if CDSs are traded on exchanges. This would reduce credit risk in the event that liquidity or solvency issues arise for market makers or participants.
  Post-2008, there is considerable concern in regulatory circles around the world that CDSs, as these are traded off stock exchanges without margins, result in unacceptably high systemic counter-party risk. RBI’s revised guidelines for CDSs on corporate bonds were issued in January 2013.13 As of now, the markets for CDSs in India are thin because the markets for the underlying security, for example, corporate bonds, are underdeveloped.
2.5. Domestic Mutual Funds and Foreign Institutional Investors
DOMESTIC MUTUAL FUNDS
SEBI’s regulations for mutual funds were put in place in 1993. Prior to that, the only mutual fund of note was the UTI set up under the UTI Act of 1964. Private mutual funds crept up on UTI in the 1990s and have surpassed UTI in the 2000s. UTI itself was responsible for this decline because of recurrent management failures and malfeasance, culminating in the dismissal of the then UTI chairman in 2001.
  Table 11 details the volumes of mutual fund assets under management in several countries. Although the size of this capital-markets segment has increased in India, it is still small by global standards.
 
  Table 11: Mutual Fund Assets—Cross-country Comparison

Table 12 shows that the volumes of assets under management (AUM) had grown steadily from 2001 till the financial-sector crash in 2008 and are rising again.

In August 2016, retail investors owned 45.3 per cent of the stock of assets managed by mutual funds while corporates accounted for 47 per cent. The remaining 7.7 per cent is held by institutional investors and banks. About 59 per cent of individual holdings are invested in equity-oriented schemes while others tend to hold their assets in liquid money-market or debt-oriented schemes.
FOREIGN INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS (FIIS)
FIIs were allowed to register with SEBI starting in 1992. In addition to the net additionality in foreign-capital inflows, the entry of FIIs has improved accounting standards and corporate governance. FIIs are well equipped to do their due diligence on market potential and auditing standards before making investments. FII investments plus American Depository Receipts and Global Depository Receipts improved awareness among international investors about Indian firms and hence their access to international capital markets. However, FIIs are involved with participatory notes (PNs), which hide the identity of foreign investors and to that extent promote round-tripping of funds.
  Table 13 shows that the outstanding stock of FII investments in Indian stocks has multiplied by more than four times over the last ten years.
 
  Table 13: Outstanding Stock of FII Investments in Equity and Debt
 
Source: SEBI.
From 2011 to 2016, FIIs have almost doubled their investments in Indian stocks. They now hold about 20 per cent of the market capitalization of Indian stocks as compared to 11 per cent in 2011. This increase has possibly been caused by the ultra-low interest rates in developed countries, including the US. Consequently, if and when US interest rates rise, there could be sizeable selling of Indian equities by FIIs.
Section III
1. Market Integrity
The following are illustrative examples of market-integrity violations since 1992. This summary does not provide anywhere near a comprehensive understanding of the multiple instances and varieties of wrongdoing in Indian capital markets.
1.1. Harshad Mehta
Over the last twenty-five years, there have been several instances of substantive violations of market integrity in Indian capital markets. For example, the Harshad Mehta (HM) stock-market scam was exposed in April 1992. HM used the Ponzi scheme model, which worked as long as stock prices kept going up. Major public and private banks, mutual funds and broking firms were complicit. A joint parliamentary committee deliberated over the causal reasons and corrective steps. However, till now, assets confiscated from HM are still frozen with a ‘custodian’ appointed by the government. It is important to reach closure in such significant cases of wrongdoing.14
1.2. Badla15
Badla transactions were banned after the HM episode. This type of trade allows buyers of stocks to postpone taking delivery by paying a mutually agreed rate of interest on the amounts owed to the sellers. Under this so-called badla methodology, stocks could be traded on payment of margins, and settlement could be deferred.16 The badla system created high counterparty risk since settlements could be deferred indefinitely.17
  The government banned badla in 1993 post the HM scam.18 However, due to the lobbying of brokers, the government allowed badla trading again in 1996.19
  The Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Stock Market Scam (2002) noted: ‘The payments crisis on the Calcutta Stock Exchange arose because SEBI in consultation with the Ministry of Finance had permitted the resumption of badla without arranging for curbing or regulating rampant off-market internal badla.’20 At the insistent prodding of government, SEBI banned badla trading for good21 in 2001.22 Exchange-traded derivative products such as futures and options were simultaneously introduced for hedging and trading purposes.23
1.3. Ketan Parekh
Stock prices dropped unexpectedly after the 2001 Budget was presented in Parliament. At the Ministry of Finance’s request, SEBI initiated investigations that spotlighted irregularities involving brokers and promoters.24 The obvious asset-liability mismatch of bank-lending against equity as collateral was exposed.25 Disregarding RBI’s guidelines, the Madhavpura Mercantile Cooperative Bank had loaned Rs 1200 crore to share brokers, including Ketan Parekh and his associates.26
1.4. UTI
Asset-liability mismatches were at the core of the UTI crisis of 2001. UTI had mopped up sizeable volumes of funds under assured return schemes and invested in equities. As equity prices went down, the net-asset values of these schemes went below that of underlying liabilities, prompting an investor run on UTI’s flagship scheme called US-64.27, 28, 29 This could have been prevented by prudent asset-liability management.
1.5. Collective Investment Schemes
In the plantation schemes of the late 1990s, investors were duped by companies with the promise of unrealistically high returns. As part of the reforms process, the Collective Investment Schemes’ Regulations were adopted in 1999 to give the required authority to SEBI.30 Purported chit-fund scams and alleged wrongdoing as in the cases of ‘Sahara’31, 32, 33 and ‘Saradha’ have also exposed regulatory shortcomings. The Ministry of Finance is now evaluating an omnibus ‘central legislation’ to prevent ‘illicit deposit taking schemes’.34
1.6. Reliance Infrastructure and Natural Resources
In January 2011, Reliance Infrastructure Ltd and Reliance Natural Resources Ltd (RNRL) were accused of having diverted proceeds of ECBs and FCCBs, in violation of regulatory guidelines, to invest in stocks. These two ADA group of companies paid Rs 50 crore ($7.5 million) to SEBI for an out-of-court settlement.35
1.7. Serious Allegations
In August 2011, an awkward incident, which was not investigated, was a letter written by the then SEBI board member K.M. Abraham directly to the prime minister alleging that North Block was interfering in the working of SEBI ‘with the knowledge of (then) Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee’. The SEBI chairman denied Abraham’s allegations as baseless.36 Given the high offices involved, such instances raise questions about the ability of SEBI–government to take anticipatory action to protect the interests of investors.
1.8. Current Status
On balance, stock-market integrity has improved over the last ten years. This is principally because the numbers of market participants and institutions have grown and diversified and they are more vigilant. Additionally, corporate-governance norms are better although there is considerable scope for improvement. The surveillance capabilities in market-infrastructure institutions such as stock exchanges are more sophisticated as also the regulatory efficiency of SEBI. However, a number of infirmities persist. For example, stock holdings are still too concentrated in the hands of promoters and institutional investors who collude, hurting the interests of dispersed retail investors. Sponsors of companies and their senior management have been often involved in dubious practices such as asset stripping and sharing of confidential information with favoured investors.
2. Systemic Risk
It was evident post-2008 that one of the causal factors for financial-sector irregularities in developed countries was excessively generous bonuses. Absurdly high levels of compensation insulate financial-sector personnel from the consequences of their actions. In India, the financial sector is still dominated by public-sector institutions. Consequently, although private-sector salaries and bonuses are high by Indian standards, these are not yet large enough to be a source of systemic risk.
  Marking-to-market is an important component of managing systemic risk. However, significant parts of our debt markets, as distinct from equity, are not adequately liquid to provide market prices. At different points on the sovereign-rupee yield curve, liquidity is not adequate to arrive at robust market-driven prices. Consequently, there are information asymmetries. Existing penalties are inadequate and should be higher if market participants push low-liquidity products without adequate disclosure about the risks involved. Additionally, legal remedies against malfeasance or regulator high-handedness need to be processed faster.
3. Auditing and Accounting Oversight
Adequate attention has not been paid to auditing and accounting integrity even though there are many examples of periodic and systematic wrongdoings. For example, BIFR has commented adversely on connivance between auditors and promoters. Rating agencies too have noted that Indian companies at times overstate/understate their profits to manipulate stock prices, particularly prior to issuance of equity. Specifically, there was no value left in Satyam stocks after its share price plummeted overnight post the announcement of its fraudulent accounting statements. PwC India was fined $6 million by SEC for not following auditing standards in the Satyam case. More recently, there were question marks about the auditing and valuations of the United Breweries group of companies by PwC, Grant Thornton and Deloitte LLP.
4. Double Taxation Avoidance Treaties
In the early 1990s, double taxation avoidance agreements (DTAAs) with Mauritius and other low-tax jurisdictions were extended to portfolio investments. In substance, this was an extension of the provisions instituted in 1983 to promote FDI from NRIs. Portfolio investments were and are important in lowering current-account deficits, given India’s perennially large deficits in goods trade. However, it is likely that a sizeable proportion of these portfolio investments is round-tripping of Indian funds.
  In February 2016, the government announced that over the next three years, tax rates on capital gains for foreign investments via Mauritius would be the same as for domestic investments.37 On 13 May 2016, the government announced that derivatives and debentures would not be covered by the amendments in the DTAA with Mauritius. Markets in ‘call and put’ options in listed Indian stocks are adequately liquid, such that these exchange-traded derivatives can be used to duplicate the payoff from underlying shares.
  For instance, the basic ‘put-call’ parity identity can be used to replicate future price movements of listed stocks. ‘Put-call’ parity holds for ‘European’ options. The parity equation is:
S = C + PV (X) – P
S: spot stock price; C: call option premium; PV (X): present value of strike price X discounted from date of maturity of option at risk-free rate; P: put option premium.
  If an investor were to buy a call option, lend the present value of the strike price at the risk-free rate and sell a ‘put’ option at the same strike price, the resulting exposure is exactly the same as if the investor had bought one share at price S at time t = 0. That is, investors could continue to use the Mauritius route to avoid capital gains taxes even after 1 April 2017, by using derivatives instead of investing directly in shares. It is also not clear why debentures have been excluded from this amended DTAA with Mauritius. Convertible (to equity) debentures could be issued in Mauritius to avoid taxes in India post-April 2017.
4.1. Coordination across Regulators
REGULATORY GAPS AND FINANCIAL STABILITY DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL (FSDC)
Financial-sector regulators have differences of opinion on issues that fall across or between regulators. This was evident in the case of unit-linked insurance schemes, which have insurance and equity characteristics. IRDA and SEBI could not agree on jurisdiction. The government has set up FSDC headed by the finance minister with the heads of RBI, SEBI and the insurance and pension regulatory bodies as members. In various quarters, concerns have been raised that a FSDC headed by the finance minister would be akin to a super regulator and the autonomy of financial-sector regulators would be compromised.
  Earlier, before FSDC was constituted, the RBI governor used to head a High-Level Financial Markets Committee. The other members of this committee, set up for purposes of coordination, were the heads of SEBI, other regulatory bodies and finance ministry officials. RBI is naturally primus inter pares compared to the other financial-sector regulators. However, occasionally, RBI was not able to achieve a consensus in the meetings of this committee since RBI has its own preoccupations about turf. For example, around 2001, when it was felt that FX dealers were trying to manipulate currency markets, RBI decided to impose restrictions on spot FX transactions. RBI insisted that this had no impact on currency-swap markets since it did not realize that all currency-swap transactions are accompanied at the outset by spot FX conversions. The FSDC headed by the finance minister would be able to resolve differences of opinion between regulators on technical or turf issues.
  In the US, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) was set up under the Dodd–Frank legislation of July 2010. FSOC is headed by the US treasury secretary and the members include chairpersons of the Federal Reserve, SEC and other regulators.
Section IV
Conclusions
Household Investments in Stocks and Debentures Compared to Other Investments
Table 14 shows that despite the significant advances made over more than two and a half decades, Indian households continue to favour bank deposits and investments in insurance or pension plans to stocks. The volume of investments in stocks and debentures dropped from 1.7 per cent of GDP in 1994–95 to 0.46 per cent in 2014–15.
  Indian MIIs such as stock exchanges, clearing and settlement corporations follow international best practices. Higher net-worth retail investors do apply for shares at the time of initial public offerings of well-known companies. However, median-income households remain hesitant participants in Indian equity markets. Moreover, average individual investors are still wary of investing in stocks and corporate bonds. This is partly because the free float of shares of well-managed companies is limited since such stocks are held closely by promoters, FIIs, domestic institutional investors and mutual funds. Additionally, the episodic yet steady flow of news about collusion across promoters, managers and others in a variety of scams dampens retail-investor sentiment.
  During high-inflation periods, households tend to invest their savings in assets that hold their value against a general rise in prices. It appears that bank deposit and contractual savings rates from 2011–12 to 2014–15 were not considered sufficiently high compared to inflation (CPI was around 9.4 to 10 and then 6.5 per cent over this period). To preserve the purchasing power of their savings, household investments probably shifted towards gold and real estate (gold imports went up from $29 billion in 2009–10 to $56 billion in 2011–12 and $54 billion in 2012–13).

Clearly, household savers are still not sufficiently knowledgeable or comfortable about the risks involved in investing in stocks.
Liberalization and Indian Capital Market Crises
In the first half of the 1990s, government policymakers acted swiftly to effect game-changing reforms in Indian capital markets. In that era, reforms were well-conceived to set up a statute-based regulator and to enhance the credibility of market-infrastructure institutions such as stock exchanges. By 1994–95, the Narasimha Rao’s government had lost its appetite for reforms, probably because Rao preferred to appease special interests with an eye to getting a second term as prime minister. The short-lived coalition governments of Gujral and Gowda were too preoccupied with remaining in power to focus on effective governance let alone improvements of any sort. Highly significant reforms were implemented by Vajpayee’s government from 1999–2004, e.g. elimination of ‘badla’, introduction of derivatives and demutualization of stock exchanges. Manmohan Singh’s government from 2004–14 took incremental steps, e.g. amendment of the Securities Contract (Regulation) Act in 2007 to allow trading of securitized debt, raised investor protection funds and made PAN numbers mandatory for stock-exchange transactions. However, these ten years were a period of missed opportunities, for instance, in the tightening of market-integrity norms and increasing the depth of corporate-debt markets.
  In retrospect, a calibrated approach to liberalizing capital markets was appropriate in the early 1990s, since it takes time to build regulatory expertise and learn from doing. However, the momentum that was rebuilt in the Vajpayee years was lost in the Manmohan Singh period of 2004–14. Additionally, government did not pay adequate attention to merit plus integrity in appointing board members and heads of SEBI, IRDA and PFRDA.
  In the last twenty years, SEBI has been led by administrative-service government officers with little formal training in finance and no market experience. In contrast, government’s choices for RBI governor/deputy governor were usually more appropriate. RBI’s senior management does not need to be as knowledgeable as those leading SEBI about market practices. This is because SEBI’s regulatory oversight is directly associated with transactions. Shortcomings in SEBI leadership have resulted in continued deficiencies in institution-building within SEBI. Indian capital markets would have developed better if the selection of key SEBI personnel, including its chairman, were to be initiated by technical specialists with acknowledged market experience rather than generalists in the finance ministry. Of course, the political executive would necessarily take final appointment decisions.
  All things considered, lighter-touch regulation should not be blamed for episodes of malfeasance because it engenders competition and lowers costs. Unfortunately, trading in stocks, debt and derivatives rather than intermediation for investment purposes is the overwhelmingly dominant activity for most globally significant financial-sector firms. SEBI has to be mindful that high trading volumes alone are not necessarily a reliable indicator of well-functioning capital markets.38
Going Forward
A more rigorous process needs to be adopted in the selection of key SEBI personnel and the SEBI Act needs to be amended to include postgraduate-level qualifications in finance/economics plus market experience. Entry-level recruitment should be based on written examinations.
  Instances of major wrongdoings in India since 1991—the Harshad Mehta episode in 1992, Ketan Parikh in 2001 and Jignesh Shah in 2013—were followed by regulatory reforms. SEBI needs to continually improve its surveillance capabilities in even closer coordination with the other financial-sector regulators. This includes early-warning systems to spot solvency as distinct from liquidity problems of market makers.
  The setting up of a government-sponsored stock exchange to ensure adequate competition, namely NSE, was crucial and NSE has maintained an untarnished reputation. Unfortunately, on 20 September 2016, it was reported39 that SEBI’s Technical Advisory Committee determined that NSE had given unfair access to some brokers for algorithmic (high-frequency) trading. It was reported separately that NSE may be close to listing. NSE is a quasi-regulator and for it to focus on increasing its profits (inevitable as a listed entity) would be inconsistent with the role of stock exchanges to ensure a level playing field across brokers and market participants, including investors.
  In the past ten years, every time government–SEBI has sought greater transparency about the beneficiary ownership and details of PNs, FIIs have sold stocks precipitously, and Indian share prices have tumbled. PNs are mostly leveraged positions on Indian stocks. SEBI should seek more details about PN structures and ownership since it is likely that round-tripping is involved.
  Markets for exchange-traded interest rate and currency derivatives are functioning well but at lower levels of liquidity compared to developed countries. To an extent, this is due to rupee interest rates, which are not adequately market determined. The government-yield curve would be arbitrage-free if short-selling of government debt securities is allowed. To that extent then, the marking of debt securities to market would be more accurate.
  The markets for OTC derivatives, such as interest rate and currency swaps are reasonably liquid but shorter in maturities as compared to corresponding markets in developed countries. If legal remedies for creditors were to be expedited, that would support development of corporate bond markets. Municipal bond markets are stirring and would gain traction as these bodies gain financial and accounting expertise.
  An important aspect of effective regulation is responsible assessment of credit risk. S & P and Moody’s are a duopoly in international financial markets and are the majority shareholders of two major Indian credit-rating agencies (CRAs), CRISIL and ICRA.40 CRAs perform a quasi-regulatory function. The government should consider setting up a public-sector CRA. This would increase competition in the ratings space, make CRAs less focused on income maximization and get them to provide better guidelines on how to interpret their credit ratings.
  The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) is too close to the accounting profession to be a dependable watchdog. The government should set up a statute-based regulator for accounting.
  Appeals against SEBI decisions are heard by the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT). Market makers and participants have often complained that SAT takes inordinately long to decide on their appeals. The Ministry of Finance has announced that the SEBI Act will be amended to allow more benches and members in SAT, and this should be followed through.
  The high-profile Saradha, so-called ‘chit fund’ scam, and purported instances of fraud involving Subrata Roy relate to allegations that retail investors were cheated through collective investment and other such schemes. In a welcome move, the government has indicated that legislative changes will be introduced within 2016–17 to counter get-rich-quick types of schemes, which are marketed to less knowledgeable and gullible investors.
  Inter-regulatory coordination is an important element of the FSDC’s mandate. The jurisdiction of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs overlaps with SEBI (e.g. accounting and registration norms) and with other financial-sector regulators. Hence, the minister for corporate affairs should be a member of the FSDC.

Institution-building in the Financial Sector: The HDFC Experience
Deepak Parekh
Two key lessons emerged for HDFC—first, that trust is the single-most important component in a financial business. Second, that the only product patent a financial institution can have in a competitive market is quality customer service. For HDFC, a value-driven culture of honesty and integrity overrides all other considerations.
Today, it is indeed hard to imagine how primitive the Indian financial system was just a quarter of a century ago. Several economic reforms and liberalization measures were ushered in as a result of the balance-of-payments crisis in 1991. This proved to be a watershed year for India. Some of the key reforms undertaken included the abolition of export subsidies, two-stage depreciation of the Indian rupee, dismantling of the licence raj, reduction in the statutory liquidity and cash reserve ratios of banks, and decontrolling interest rates. However, at that time, few believed that these wide-sweeping reforms would structurally alter the Indian economy.
  To better understand the impact of the economic reforms on a financial institution like the Housing Development Finance Corporation Limited (HDFC), it is useful to reflect on the origins of the institution. HDFC was set up in 1977 as India’s first retail housing finance company. At that time, it was akin to a start-up. The only difference was that unlike most start-ups, which are largely set up by young entrepreneurs, this one was a post-retirement venture by the founder, H.T. Parekh. He was sixty-five years old and had retired as the executive chairman of ICICI. The dream to set up a housing finance company in India had germinated in his mind when he was a student studying in the United Kingdom. He had keenly observed that in almost every high street in the UK, there was a building society. Similarly, in the US, there were savings and loan associations. Yet, India remained bereft of any such institution. This thought lingered on in his mind throughout his student days and career, and fructified only two years after he retired. This was the origin of HDFC.
  A year after HDFC was set up, I joined the company. I had spent the initial years of my career as an investment banker. Changing tracks after that to join a new start-up company may well have been risky. There were conflicts to deal with. I was giving up a secure job with a foreign bank to join a new company that was still being perceived with a great deal of scepticism. No one in India had so far attempted to finance individuals for their housing needs. Access to long-term finance was difficult and no foreclosure norms existed. At that time, most Indians were extremely debt averse. On the personal front, it meant a drastic reduction in terms of my salary and other benefits. Perhaps it was the excitement and challenge of building a new institution that goaded me to join HDFC. Though our beginnings were small, there was an instant sense of gratification in the work we were doing. One thing was clear to me right from the inception of the company: the need for housing finance was dire and the demand for home loans was immense.
  HDFC remained the only housing finance player in India till the late 1980s when insurance companies, public-sector banks and a few private players set up housing finance companies. HDFC also promoted four other housing finance companies. In effect, HDFC created competition for itself!
  In 1987, a decade after HDFC came into existence, the National Housing Bank was established as the regulator for housing finance companies, following the recommendations of the Rangarajan Committee.
  The housing finance market, though deeply underpenetrated, was beginning to grow as more dedicated players set up companies. Commercial banks, however, preferred to stay away from direct lending of home loans. In fact, commercial banks did not focus on growing their retail portfolios till the late 1990s.
Lessons Learnt from the Financial Crisis
The challenge of growing the housing finance business predominantly concerned raising adequate long-term resources. During the 1980s, HDFC had successfully tapped long-term international funding from the World Bank (guaranteed by the Government of India), International Finance Corporation and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under the housing guarantee programme. On the domestic front, funding mainly came from commercial banks, state insurance companies and the Unit Trust of India.
  The business of HDFC was a simple one—borrowing wholesale funds and lending them to retail customers at a fixed rate of interest, typically earning a modest spread of around 2 per cent. However, in 1990, the Gulf War came as a rude shock for the Indian economy. Oil prices rose sharply and India’s depleted foreign-currency reserves had left the country on the brink of default. The situation was exacerbated by political instability and unsustainably high fiscal deficits. To curtail rising double-digit inflation rates, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raised interest rates sharply. Pre-empting bank credit, the statutory liquidity ratio reached its peak of 38.5 per cent and the cash reserve ratio hovered at 15 per cent.
  For a lending institution like HDFC, which was dependent on wholesale funds, the RBI’s actions were stifling. What was worrisome was that the pipeline of home loan approvals was getting stronger but the resource base was shrinking. HDFC also recognized that there was a threshold limit on interest rates beyond which customers would find it difficult to borrow or service the loan. Home loan interest rates had already reached a peak of 18.5 per cent per annum. HDFC knew that it could not afford to renege on its home loan commitments. It just had to find new avenues of raising resources.
  At this critical juncture, HDFC realized that it had, over the years, built up a strong brand name, synonymous with quality customer service and trust. HDFC decided to capitalize on this goodwill by raising retail deposits. While its term deposit rates were marginally higher than the banks’, the key differentiator was the level of service provided. HDFC decided to give the deposit certificate over the counter. This was in contrast to customers having to wait for weeks before getting their deposit receipts. At that time, this convenience was a novelty and helped the company garner substantial resources.
  Though retail funding in normal conditions entails a higher cost than wholesale funding, it is a stable form of funding, particularly in periods of disruption. Over the years, HDFC has built a strong network of agents, who today also cross-sell a variety of financial products within the HDFC group.
  Little did one expect history to repeat itself so quickly. The contagion effect of the global financial crisis of 2008 resulted in a temporary liquidity freeze in India. Sanctioned bank loans to HDFC were withdrawn overnight as markets faced a crisis of confidence. Once again, for the company, it was the retail deposit franchise that saved the day. Savers trusted the HDFC name and knew that their money would be safe. It was the retail funding component that helped HDFC meet its financial commitments during the period of the liquidity freeze.
  Two key lessons emerged for HDFC—first, that trust is the single-most important component in a financial business. Second, that the only product patent a financial institution can have in a competitive market is quality customer service.
The Opening Up of the Banking Sector: A Turning Point
In the period post the nationalization of banks and up until 1993, the Indian banking system had regressed considerably. Tongue in cheek, it was often said that bankers did not do banking; they merely carried out orders of the powers that be.
  Today, there is much lament about the state of the banking sector with the build-up of non-performing loans and stressed assets, particularly in public-sector banks. However, reflecting back on the pre-liberalization era, one realizes that back then, banks did not fix any interest rates—they were all mandated. There were no prudential norms, no regulations on capital adequacy or rules for non-performing loans. Even opening a bank branch would take months after seeking the approval of the RBI.
  Clearly, the turning point was the opening up of the banking sector to private players in 1993. There was an advertisement in newspapers calling for potential applicants. This aroused my curiosity and I thought it would be a good idea to apply for a bank licence. There was a time period of three months to make the application. The threshold entry limit was high, with a minimum capital requirement of Rs 1 billion. At that time, HDFC’s net worth was around Rs 3 billion. I was convinced that the time was right for HDFC to have some diversification in its business. However, when the proposal to apply for a bank licence was placed before HDFC’s board of directors, the initial rejection took me aback.
  The argument put forth was that HDFC was a single-product company, with no experience in banking. Some board members asked as to why a well-established company should risk its reputation by venturing into a business it had no expertise in. Needless to say, it took a lot of convincing to get the board to agree to just put in an application. The board finally consented and we agreed that HDFC would have to tap an external talent pool if we did get a licence. In short, HDFC Bank almost did not happen—but that is history now.
  In 1993, there were over forty aspiring applicants for a banking licence—some were even fictitious, having sent in their application on a postcard! The chairman of the committee appointed by the RBI to grant the licences was S.S. Marathe, who was also a member on RBI’s board.
  One of the conditions stipulated for getting a licence was that the head office of the bank would have to be in a city other than Mumbai. HDFC took its chances and requested for the head office to be in Mumbai. To our surprise, it was the first to receive a bank licence. Marathe mentioned to me that HDFC’s application was the best and hence we were allowed our preference of having the head office in Mumbai.
  The RBI articulated that an arm’s-length relationship needed to be maintained between HDFC and HDFC Bank. There could be no lines of credit or any form of lending by the latter to the former. The objective of launching the bank was that HDFC had developed relationships with a number of corporates over the years, but as a housing finance company it could not lend to them like banks do. Initially, it was envisaged that the bank would focus exclusively on wholesale banking activities. This idea, however, had to be abandoned soon. There was a recognition that the key to survival was going to be the ability to ramp up low-cost current-and savings-account deposits. Thus began the journey towards building up the bank’s retail lending portfolio. This strategy has held the bank in good stead over the years as across the Indian banking system, non-performing loans in retail finance sector has remained low.
  HDFC Bank had a competent team in place and laid a great deal of emphasis on capitalizing on technology and putting in place automated processes and systems to improve the overall customer experience.
  The key beneficiary of opening up banking to the private sector was clearly the customer. With competition increasing, public-sector banks had to raise the bar of customer service. Competition also gave the impetus to public-sector banks to embrace automation and computerization.
  Towards the late 1990s, against the backdrop of an industrial slowdown, banks recognized that if they needed to remain profitable, they would have to focus on growing their retail portfolio. By this time, the typical Indian consumer had a higher disposable income, rising aspirations and was considerably less debt averse. As banks started focusing on growing their home loan portfolios, there was a shift from fixed-rate mortgages to floating rates. Banks also concentrated on growing other retail loans such as consumer, auto, credit card and personal loans. With increased competition, retail finance in India transformed into a buyer’s market.
Insurance Joint Ventures: A Game Changer
During the same period when the banking sector was opened up to the private sector, there was also the recognition of the need to bring in reforms in the insurance sector. In 1993, under the chairmanship of R.N. Malhotra, a committee was set up to make recommendations on the insurance sector. I was fortunate to have been a member of this committee. It did a lot of groundwork, field visits and surveys to understand the sector better. I recall working over many weekends—both on Saturdays and Sundays—with several visits to New Delhi and long meetings at the office of the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC).
  After a great deal of hard work, the report was submitted in January 1994, with a clear recommendation that private players be allowed in the sector. Given the fact that insurance expertise was lacking in the country, the committee made a strong case for allowing foreign companies to enter India, preferably through joint ventures with Indian partners. The committee also recommended the setting up of the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA), which would be the autonomous body to regulate and develop the sector.
  Unfortunately, the report turned out to be more contentious than it was anticipated to be. While the Union’s protectionist and xenophobic attitude was not surprising, there was resistance to various other recommendations as well. The report highlighted the need to desist from the indiscriminate practice of recruiting agents who were not trained to sell insurance products. There was a need for greater transparency on commissions and other emoluments being paid out. The committee also recommended that funds of insurance companies be invested more dynamically to include non-government securities. Like most politically sensitive issues, the report was put into cold storage for several years.
  At HDFC, we remained hopeful that the sector would eventually open up, but reconciled ourselves to the fact that it would take time. We were fortunate that our identified life insurance partner, Standard Life Plc, UK, was very patient while waiting for the sector to open up. During this period of waiting, HDFC and Standard Life Investments joined hands in another venture, HDFC Asset Management Company Limited, which went on to become one of India’s largest mutual funds.
  While a lot of groundwork was already being done to prepare for the life insurance company’s launch, it was only in the year 2000 that HDFC Life became the first private life insurance company to be registered by the insurance regulator, IRDA.
  With the opening up of the sector, many joint ventures fructified. But the sector was beset with many teething troubles. There was a lot of mis-selling of insurance products, and the regulatory environment was shaky. There were too many regulatory changes happening too frequently which created instability for the business. Much of these issues are now well behind us.
  Life insurance is a long-gestation business and a capital guzzler in the initial years. Due to Indian accounting norms, life insurance companies incur accounting losses initially as commission expenses are charged upfront in the year in which they are incurred, while the corresponding income is recognized over the entire life of the policies issued. The mismatch between expenses and income magnified the initial losses. Further, the passing of the legislation to increase foreign direct investment (FDI) in the insurance sector from 26 per cent to 49 per cent took longer than anticipated. As a result, it was the domestic partner who had to contribute a larger share to fund the growth of these companies. It took almost a decade for the stronger life insurance companies to break even. Over this long period, however, considerable value had been built up in these companies. This is also evident from the fact that the market share of LIC has steadily reduced from a monopolistic position up until 2000 to around 52 per cent currently.
  On the non-life insurance side, HDFC in 2002 entered into a joint venture with Chubb Global Financial Services Corporation, one of the largest property-casualty insurers in the US. It was with this joint venture that one recognized that in business, while one does not just need a partner for technical expertise, a meeting of minds is important. Chubb was extremely cautious and reluctant to underwrite business in India while other private non-life insurance players were already growing at a fast clip. The need for a changed strategy was repeatedly discussed across the table. When it bore no fruit, the only finality was for the partners to mutually part ways in 2007.
  This was the first joint venture that failed since the insurance sector was opened up. Fortunately, HDFC had the wherewithal to buy out Chubb’s stake, but the company had lost much ground. We were extra-cautious in identifying our new partner. The key concern was finding a partner who would share our long-term commitment to grow the business in India.
  Five months after the fallout with the first partner, the ball started rolling again when HDFC entered into a new joint venture with ERGO International AG, a Munich Re subsidiary. The timing was fortuitous with the new partnership being signed in New Delhi in the presence of the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the then prime minister Manmohan Singh. With the right partner in place, it was business as usual once again.
The HDFC Group of Companies
From being a single-product company, HDFC has diversified into a financial conglomerate with interests spread across banking, insurance, asset management, rural housing finance, property venture funds and education finance in twenty-five-years’ time. Each of these businesses runs as separate, legal entities.
  The objective of setting up various companies was to enable a customer to avail himself of a variety of financial products and services under the HDFC umbrella. While setting up all the HDFC group companies, HDFC has never charged for the use of its brand name. The only condition laid down is an oral commitment that the HDFC name is to be used carefully, always keeping in mind that the brand name is synonymous with trust and quality customer service.
  HDFC’s strategy over the years has been to diversify into new businesses as and when regulatory changes come about. Another key policy reform that has helped the financial sector has been the liberalization of the FDI regime. Though FDI limits vary for different financial sectors, the reform has helped garner large investments.
  HDFC as the parent company holds investments in its subsidiary and associate companies and also carries out mortgage finance business. Each of the group companies has different sectoral regulators. The regulatory environment is certainly more vigilant and evolved today. But, for a financial conglomerate dealing with multiplicity of regulators, there are inherent challenges. Further, constraints within the existing regulatory, legal and taxation framework continue to impede the creation of an efficient holding company structure or for the merging of entities within the group.
  Growth within the HDFC group of companies has been achieved through a combination of the organic and the inorganic. The underlying philosophy in every acquisition that the HDFC group has undertaken is that the sum of the whole should always be greater than its parts. Mergers and acquisitions in India entail dealing with challenges of multiple regulatory approvals and a complex legal system. Integration comes with its own set of challenges but experience demonstrates that a judicious handling of human resources is of utmost importance.
Beyond Wealth Creation
If one looks at the composition of the Bombay Stock Exchange Sensex over two and a half decades, there has been a vast transformation. Out of thirty stocks that were part of the Sensex in 1992, only seven companies still form a part of the Sensex today. If the stock market is considered to be the barometer of an economy, it is surprising that twenty-five years ago, there were no banking stocks in the Sensex. Today, financial stocks dominate the Sensex.
  In 1992, HDFC’s market capitalization was Rs 3.15 billion and all the shares were held domestically. Today, HDFC’s market capitalization is Rs 2.2 trillion and the foreign shareholding stands at 77 per cent. Taking the combined market capitalization of the three listed entities within the HDFC group, it is in excess of Rs 5.6 trillion ($85 billion). Clearly, vast shareholder wealth has been created in the financial sector in the post-liberalization era. The next stage of value creation in the financial sector will come from insurance companies, many of which are on the anvil of listing.
  While considerable value has been built up in HDFC and its group companies, what has been equally gratifying is the fact that HDFC has enabled millions of Indians to become proud homeowners. At the turn of the liberalization era in 1991, HDFC had cumulatively financed 0.12 million housing units. By 2016, HDFC had cumulatively financed over 5.5 million housing units. Housing finance in India is a volume-driven business. Today, outstanding housing loans stand at over Rs 3 trillion ($45 billion).
A People-driven Business
It is important for employees to feel a sense of ownership in the company they work for. This is what enables employees to give their best. When the company does well, the employees as shareholders prosper. I do not think any of us from the start-up team at HDFC ever imagined we would grow at the pace we did and eventually diversify into becoming a financial conglomerate. I am often asked this question by many—what was it that HDFC did differently from others?
  No doubt, we had the first-mover advantage. In our initial years, with no other competitor, we had the leeway to learn from the mistakes we made on the way. But I think it is the culture and people that made the difference. Right from the inception of HDFC, the founder chairman H.T. Parekh believed in an open-door policy and developed a work environment that encouraged feedback, irrespective of hierarchy. Most people who joined HDFC in its early years have stayed on and thus the attrition rate is low. People tend to stay on in their jobs if they are treated well and if they value and appreciate the culture of the management. For HDFC, a value-driven culture of honesty and integrity override all other considerations. The senior management has always believed that the demonstrative effect has to start at the top and it is the role of the senior management to ensure that the values and culture of the organization percolate to all levels.
Macro Assessment of Twenty-five Years of Financial Reforms
The opening up of various financial sectors by allowing the entry of private players has been one of the greatest success stories under the reform agenda. The setting up of a number of supporting financial institutions such as rating agencies and credit bureaus has also helped deepen the financial markets. HDFC had the privilege of being a promoter of the Credit Rating Information Services of India Limited, the country’s first rating agency, and the Credit Information Bureau (India) Limited, India’s first credit bureau.
  For a highly under-penetrated financial market like India, there is enough space to accommodate several new and differentiated players. The thrust towards financial inclusion portends well when it comes to deepening the markets and targeting different customer segments. Competition is beneficial for the development of financial markets as long as the players are not irrational and desist from practices such as rampant undercutting of interest rates, merely to garner market share.
  When it comes to customers, greater options and choice have meant that they are being increasingly demanding. But this also ensures that the bar for quality customer service keeps rising. Regulators too have become increasingly vigilant to minimize mis-selling of financial products and services, and have made timely interventions to curtail business practices that are deemed unfair towards customers. In the current regulatory milieu, one is more confident that the days of dodgy and fly-by-night financial players are now well behind us.
  India’s favourable demographic profile, growing disposable incomes, better job opportunities and the rising middle class augur well for the growth of retail finance in the country. Banks and financial institutions are already reorienting their strategies as younger customers lean towards digitization and mobile-banking transactions. Quite evidently, in a post–economic-reform era, the key differentiator between winners and the others in the financial sector have been those who consciously imbibed a strong culture of customer empathy, integrity and transparency.
  To conclude, there remain several challenges in the Indian financial sector such as reducing the build-up of non-performing assets, particularly in public-sector banks, deepening the debt markets and finding optimal solutions and institutional mechanisms to sustainably fund long-term infrastructure projects. The Indian financial system has never been short of solutions, though often the obstruction has come by way of a lack of consensus and the will to bite the bullet.
  Despite these challenges, the Indian economy has never been on such a firm footing as it is today. Twenty-five years ago, perhaps out of compulsion rather than choice, India undertook ‘big bang’ reforms. Today, India is comfortable with an ‘incremental’ reform approach. The pace of reforms adopted by a country is always a debatable issue. What is of significance is that India at present has the leeway to make its own choice regarding the pace of reforms. Besides the optimism of being the world’s fastest-growing major economy, there is a growing consensus that India’s best is still to come.

INDIAN BUSINESS: LAUNCHED ON A NEW TRAJECTORY

Changes and Challenges: Corporate India since 1991
Omkar Goswami
Despite some ups and downs, there is no doubt that the corporate sector of India has flourished in almost unimaginable ways in the last quarter of a century. There have been two fascinating elements to this growth. Both involve ‘the churn’: one that threw aside a large number of inefficiently run, but hitherto famous, corporations; and the opposite that brought to the fore companies which were either non-existent or at the bottom of the pecking order.
An earlier chapter of this volume (‘Remembering 1991 . . . and Before’) touched upon the state of India before the launching of reforms in July 1991, and the effect that the first set of such reforms had on a country desperate for change. This chapter, which focuses on large- and medium-scale corporate entities and how these fared over the quarter century since July 1991, is no place to give further details on the many reforms that occurred—and those that did not—under Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao, as well as his successors: H.D. Deve Gowda, I.K. Gujral, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Manmohan Singh and the present incumbent, Narendra Modi. Nevertheless, a few points are worth making.
  First, none can deny that over the last twenty-five years, there have been significant reforms in various sectors of the economy—telecommunications, capital markets, central and commercial banking, insurance, indirect and direct taxes, foreign portfolio and direct investments, to name some.
  Second, while many of the reforms may have been carried out in a haphazard, stop-and-go manner, these have together created an environment to unleash entrepreneurial freedom and energy of the kind that India never saw over the forty-four years from 1947 to 1991, which has created a large and economically powerful corporate sector that, in most parts, takes its growth and investment decisions independent of the state.
  Third, it is necessary to admit some economic failures: conspicuous lack of divestment or privatization, despite annual budgetary targets; insufficient labour-market reforms; poor infrastructure, be it roads, highways, ports or power distribution; inability to create a manufacturing ethos and raise its share from roughly 16 per cent of GDP; failure of bankruptcy processes; difficulties in acquisition of land for factories and in getting mining rights; and, perhaps most seriously, inadequate recognition of the fact that over the next fifteen years, India will have some 12–15 million people entering the potential workforce per annum, in an environment where increasing productivity of information technology and machines coupled with a distinct disinclination to hire more workers has led to negative employment elasticities across all sectors of the economy.
  In essence, this chapter uses large databases of listed companies to evaluate how corporate India fared over the last twenty-five years since the advent of reforms in July 1991. Many themes emerge: unparalleled corporate growth coupled with enormous churning; the rise in corporate concentration across industries; the behaviour of critical costs such as wages and salaries and interest payments; the extent of leveraging; the story of state-owned enterprises (SOEs); why manufacturing still does not grow fast enough; widespread failure of infrastructure and, despite liberalization, the enormous difficulties in doing business in India; the deeply worrying reality of virtually employment-less growth; and some ideas of reform, if we have to do significantly better in the next twenty-five years than we have in the previous quarter.
Corporate Growth and ‘the Churn’: 1991 versus 2016
It is impossible to overstate the extent of corporate growth that has occurred in India since the summer of 1991. To understand this, we need to reflect upon the data for all listed companies given in Prowess, the corporate database prepared and updated by the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy (CMIE). These are given in Table 1 and Chart A. Consider some of the basic facts between 31 March 1991 and 31 March 2016:
1. The top-line (gross sales plus other operating income) for all listed companies was eleven times greater in 2016 than in 1991.
2. Profit after tax (PAT) was twenty-five times greater in the course of these twenty-five years.
3. Market capitalization was 118 times greater.
4. Simply stated, the top-line grew at 10 per cent per annum, PAT at 13 per cent, and market cap at 19 per cent. India had not witnessed such corporate growth rates—or anything remotely close—in the period between Independence and 1990.

Note: *There were very few listed financial-service companies in 1991. Subsequent listing of several banks and non-banking financial companies substantially increased the heft.
  Chart A: How Corporates Grew, 1991 versus 2016
 
There have been two fascinating elements to this growth. Both involve ‘the churn’, one that threw aside a large number of inefficiently run, but hitherto famous, corporations; and the opposite that brought to the fore companies that were either non-existent or at the bottom of the pecking order. The best way to understand this is to first pick companies that belonged to the top fifty in market capitalization, as of April 1991, and then examine their ranking across every five-year period, up to 2016. The other is to do just the opposite: take the top fifty in April 2016, and assess how these grew in prominence over the quarter century.
  First the losers. Consider the top fifty companies listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) on the first trading day of April 1991. These have been ranked in descending order of market cap. Table 2 gives the data. The sample has been arranged in groups of ten: the ten highest in market cap, then eleven to twenty, and so on. For the first ten in 1991, the mean rank is 5.5, or the average of the numbers from 1 to 10. Similarly, the next decile’s average rank is 15.5, and so on. Now, examine the top ten. Compared to 1991, this group’s average rank fell by 12.4 places in just the first five years, by 43.6 places in 2001 and by 75.3 places in 2016 vis-à-vis 1991. The second group of companies—ranked eleventh to twentieth in market cap in 1991—fared far worse. The average rank fell by 30 places in the first five years; by almost 80 in the first ten; and by over 202 by April 2016. Chart B depicts the data.

  Chart B: How Yesterday’s Mighties Fell (Drop in Market Cap Rank)
 
Here are some 1991 leaders that just could not cope with a more competitive milieu, and plummeted. Ballarpur (now BILT), then led by Lalit Thapar, was fifteenth in 1991. By 1996, its rank fell to fifty-six. Five years later, it went down to 110. This secular decline continued at an increasing pace. Despite significant investments and modernization carried out by Lalit Thapar’s successor Gautam, its rank stood at 441 in April 2016—a tragic outcome for what was once the flagship of a prominent business group. Escorts, a Delhi-based engineering and tractor-manufacturing major, founded by H.P. Nanda, was twenty-third in 1991. After the first five years, its rank had dropped to seventy-eight, five years later to eighty-six, and by 2016 it was placed at 332, completely outclassed by other tractor and earth-moving manufacturers. Bombay Dyeing, managed by Nusli Wadia, was ranked twenty in 1991. It dropped to the fiftieth position in 1996, to 183 in 2001, and was at a pathetic 420 in April 2016, prompting the cruel jibe of Bombay Dyeing becoming Bombay Dead. Mukand Iron and Steel, founded by the Shah and Bajaj families and then run by Viren Shah’s older son Rajesh, was thirty-ninth in 1991. In a decade, its rank had dropped to 329. By April 2016, it was at 550. Nocil, a major rubber chemicals manufacturing entity, founded by the Mafatlals, was at twenty-five in April 1991. Five years later, it was down to ninety-nine, by 2001 it was at 200, and in April 2016, it languished at 462.
  There were several others. The reasons for such a sharp decline in ranking were manifold, of which two need stating. First, many manufacturing entities of the early 1990s were inherently inefficient and had survived thanks to a cossetted, non-competitive regime of entry barriers and astronomical tariffs and quotas. Once these were removed, such firms were cruelly exposed to international as well as domestic competition. This, in 1993, prompted the so-called ‘Bombay Club’ to put out a petition urging a brake on reforms.1 Second, several new entrants, as well as those who were lower in the pecking order but could deal with greater competition, rapidly went up the scale and substantially changed the ranking.
  Here are the facts:
1. Six of the top ten companies ranked by market cap in April 2016 were either not listed or non-existent in April 1991. These were: TCS (ranked first in 2016), Infosys (third), HDFC Bank (fifth, which did not exist in 1991), Sun Pharma (sixth), ONGC (eighth) and SBI (tenth).
2. Eight of the next ten were either unlisted or did not exist in April 1991: ICICI Bank (eleventh and non-existent as a commercial bank in 1991), Wipro (twelfth), Bharti Airtel (thirteenth), Kotak Mahindra Bank (fourteenth, non-existent in 1991), HCL Technologies (fifteenth), Maruti Suzuki (seventeenth), NTPC (nineteenth) and Axis Bank (twentieth, non-existent in 1991).
3. Thirty-two of the top fifty companies ranked by market cap in April 2016 were either unlisted or did not exist in April 1991. Only eighteen were listed. The contrast gets sharper as one goes down the line.
Basically, then, the competitive churn threw up new enterprises that rapidly grew in corporate valuation as they relentlessly pushed down those that failed to adjust to the changing times. Nothing could have been better for the health of corporate India.
Corporate Concentration, Profits, Cost Structures and Leveraging
How did this churn affect the structure of corporate India? First, what happened to corporate concentration? Simply put, notwithstanding greater entry of companies, did the market share of the larger corporations increase or decline? To evaluate this, we look at the net sales (sales-less indirect taxes) of a large sample of listed manufacturing and non-financial-service-sector companies across two discrete time periods: 31 March 1991 and 31 March 2016. The answer is unambiguous: corporate concentration has increased quite substantially over the period of 1991-2016. There is nothing particularly worrying about this. Indeed, it is arguably inevitable. Greater economic freedom created an environment where larger firms disproportionately increased their net sales compared to their smaller counterparts. Table 3 and Chart C depict the facts.

  Chart C: The Rise in Concentration (Percentage of Net Sales, Manufacturing Companies)
 
The increase in concentration of profits is even more pronounced, be these earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA); earnings before interest and taxes; profit before tax; or PAT. Again, this is to be expected. In general, those manufacturing firms that have grown significantly faster than others have tended to generate greater profits than the rest.
  What does this mean for ‘crony capitalism’? It is an indisputable fact that the Herfindahl indices and Gini coefficients have increased across almost all industry groups—in manufacturing, mining, non-financial services. However, the fact that concentration has grown does not automatically imply that this has been predicated upon crony capitalism—a state where it is assumed that most, if not all, companies at the top of their pecking order secured special advantages from the central and state governments to get to their dominant market positions. We tend to confuse this causality: crony capitalism certainly increases industrial concentration; but a rise in such concentration does not necessarily imply a ubiquitous regime of crony capitalism.
  Having said so, in some sectors there is certainly reason to believe that corporate groups have reached the top echelons through systematically cultivated quid-pro-quo relationships with the state. This is true of mining, power generation, telecommunications, private ports and airports, and businesses that have needed large purchases of land. It is important to note that these are sectors where the State, be it the central or state governments, has not only enormous discretionary powers but also considerable say in who gets these resources and who does not. Not surprisingly, the two largest public scandals under the Congress-led UPA-I and UPA-II government (2004–14) were in the allocation of coal-mining rights to power-generating companies and in spectrum to the mobile-telecom operators—both of which led to draconian interventions by the Supreme Court of India which, while attempting to fix the malaise, pushed back growth by some three to four years.
  Two issues need to be addressed before moving on to profitability, costs and leveraging. First, given substantial differences in profitability, cost and gearing between manufacturing and (non-financial) service-sector companies, it is necessary to distinguish these. Thus, instead of averaging the relevant numbers across both sets of firms, we report these separately, wherever appropriate. Second, there is a data issue. Until the financial year ending 31 March 2001 (FY 2001), all Indian companies were required to publish their annual accounts on a ‘stand-alone’ basis only. Thus, a listed company would give such data only for its stand-alone operations, but not for its subsidiaries, associated or joint-venture enterprises. This changed from FY 2002, when it became mandatory to publish consolidated accounts in addition to the stand-alone.2 In what follows, data for the period FY 1991 to FY 2001 are from stand-alone accounts, and from FY 2002 to FY 2015 are from consolidated financial statements. The exception is leveraging, where only the consolidated financials have been considered, because these give fundamentally more accurate estimates of a listed company’s total corporate debt and leverage.
  What is the story of profitability between FY 1991 and FY 2015? Chart D plots the data for companies in manufacturing and non-financial-sector services. It shows that:
* There has been no significant secular uptick or downtrend in EBITDA to net sales, either in manufacturing or in services. At the advent of reforms, the ratio was 12.7 per cent for the listed manufacturing firms. It fell to a trough to 10.9 per cent in FY 2000, with many firms still struggling to deal with greater competition, then gradually peaked at 15.9 per cent in FY 2010, after which aggregate demand compression and relatively lower GDP growth brought it down to 12.4 per cent in FY 2015. The EBITDA margin for firms operating in the non-financial-service sectors stood at 18.7 per cent in FY 1991; with some wobbles, this rose to 22.4 per cent in FY 2014 before settling at 19.8 per cent in FY 2015.
* On average, firms in the business of providing services have consistently earned higher EBITDA margins than their counterparts in manufacturing. It is largely on account of the sheer weight of India’s major IT companies, which have always earned substantial EBITDA margins. It is also to be expected; after all, there is far more intense competition from imports in manufacturing than in services, which are in most part non-tradable.
* Moreover, there has been a clear adverse effect of an uncompetitive and overvalued real, effective exchange rates. Facts bear this out. Since the early to mid-2000s, there has been a consistent inflow of about 6 per cent of GDP—half of it from exports of IT and business process outsourcing (BPO), and the other half in the form of remittances from non-resident Indians. Hence, India has had a constant flow of around 6 per cent of GDP from these two items of net invisibles. Consequently, even a manageable current-account deficit of 2 per cent of GDP translates to a merchandise trade deficit of around 8 per cent of GDP. This clearly indicates an overvalued exchange rate for manufacturing, which has put severe limits on exports of manufactures and, therefore, additional growth.
  Chart D: EBITDA to Net Sales, Manufacturing and Non-financial Services
 
The difference in financial performance between listed manufacturing companies and their non-financial-service-sector counterparts also shows up in the return on net worth (RONW).3 Chart E plots the data.
  Chart E: Return on Net Worth, Manufacturing and Services
 
The pattern is quite similar to the share of EBITDA to net sales, as depicted in Chart D. The onset of competition and rising interest costs from 1996 to 1999—as the RBI kept raising the policy rates to quell inflationary pressures—led to a drop in manufacturing RONW from a high of 25.7 per cent in FY 1995 to a trough of 5.7 per cent in FY 1999. Thereafter, it picked up, initially gingerly and then very rapidly to a peak of 47 per cent in FY 2008, in line with a GDP growth that surged first to 8 per cent and then for three consecutive years to over 9 per cent, with companies simultaneously getting leaner and more efficient in their manufacturing practices, working capital management and inventory turns. Then came the global financial crisis and decline in GDP growth, which, in turn, led to falling demand: consequently, manufacturing RONW steadily dropped to 15.8 per cent in FY 2015. It remains around the mid-teens today.
  Throughout the period—be it in the downswings or upturns—the RONW for firms in the non-financial-service sector remained generally higher than their compatriots in manufacturing. Thanks to the IT majors, it peaked at 71.7 per cent in FY 2008, which was 24.7 percentage points higher than that of manufacturing for the same year. Subsequently, it declined thanks to international and national demand compression. Even so, it clocked 43.6 per cent in FY2015, which happens to be among the highest global average RONW for companies in services.
  This raises an important question: how much of this distinct difference in profitability and return on net worth between the manufacturing companies and their non-financial-service-sector counterparts is on account of the consistently brilliant operational and financial performance of India’s IT and BPO entities? The answer is: a lot. Consider RONW, for instance. By FY 2005, IT and IT-enabled services such as BPO accounted for a third of the entire RONW earned by all listed firms in the non-financial-service industries. This share increased to over 50 per cent by FY 2011 and thereafter rose to over 75 per cent. Indeed, without IT, BPO and other such IT-enabled services, the overall profitability of services is sometimes no different from that of manufacturing, and in several years, lower. This is especially true over the last five years.
  How have manufacturing costs behaved over time, especially in terms of wages and interest? In an environment where firms have had no control over raw material and fuel costs, these companies have been very adroit in keeping wages and interest on a light leash. Chart F plots the data from the consolidated financial statements. Wage and salary costs as a share of net sales have remained remarkably stable, drifting gently upward by just 1 percentage point over thirteen years, from 4.7 per cent in FY 2002 to 5.7 per cent in FY 2015. This has not been just the ‘denominator effect’ or rising net sales keeping a check on the ratio. Instead, while companies have effected annual wage and salary increases, most have compensated by reducing both permanent and temporary employees. This is something that will be discussed later in the chapter.
  Chart F: Wages and Interest Costs to Net Sales, Manufacturing
 
Interest costs, now aggregated as ‘financial-service expenses’ under the new Indian Accounting Standards terminology, initially fell quite substantially from 3.9 per cent in FY 2002 to 1.8 per cent in FY 2006. Then came a phase of widespread debt-financed capacity expansion, what with India galloping to a 9 per cent-plus GDP growth. That steadily raised the interest cost, which stood at 4.4 per cent in FY 2015. Though interest cost indubitably increased, it is not at an alarming level for the manufacturing companies. However, it is most certainly so for construction and real-estate firms, to which we now turn.
  Across the globe, corporations engaged in construction and real estate are always more leveraged than either manufacturing or non-financial-service-sector companies. It is the nature of the business. Real-estate and construction companies borrow heavily to buy land banks and execute their projects with the expectation that they will get adequate payment streams from customers and clients to service interest and even raise fresh debt. So, greater leveraging is not a problem per se. It becomes an issue when apartments cannot be sold, or when clients do not pay the construction contractors on time. This is what has happened to the sector during the last decade, more so after FY 2008. Charts G and H clearly show this disquieting trend.
  Chart G: Gearing, Manufacturing vs Construction and Real Estate
 
Until FY 2006, the gearing of construction and real-estate companies were under reasonable control—with a debt to equity ratio of 3.88 versus 0.96 for the manufacturing firms. Thereafter, the boom that continued right up to FY 2010, egged on by massive deficit financing in the last two years to combat the deflationary effects of the global financial crisis, led to significantly higher gearing for the construction and real-estate sector based on the expectation that the good days would continue and that India would somehow be immune to any demand compression. Leveraging grew substantially; as did financial costs to net sales.
  Chart H: Financial Cost, Manufacturing vs Construction and Real Estate
 
By FY 2011, it was clear that infrastructure spends were drying up and that the supply of apartments and office blocks were significantly higher than the demand. Moreover, state and central-government clients of construction companies started to go slow on their payments. To somehow keep themselves afloat, these construction and real-estate companies borrowed even more and, with it, both gearing and financial-servicing costs escalated to unsustainable levels. By FY 2015, their debt to equity ratio reached an astronomical 7.99; and their financial service costs stood at 12.7 per cent of net sales. Today, barring a handful, these firms are totally in the red and have absolutely no financial wherewithal to successfully execute any major infrastructure project, even when they win the contract. Indeed, the fate of infrastructural growth, which is so central to the sustainability of the Indian economy, is under threat because of the terrible financial health of such companies.
  To summarize then:
1. Despite some ups and downs, there is no doubt that the corporate sector in India has flourished in almost unimaginable ways in the last quarter of a century. Gross income has grown eleven times over the period. PAT has increased twenty-five times. And market capitalization has risen an astounding 118 times, giving listed companies more value than ever before.
2. With this growth has come significantly greater market concentration. The top 10 per cent of listed companies in 1991 accounted for 69 per cent of total net sales in 1991. By 2015, this share had risen to over 79 per cent. The Herfindahl Index (higher this is, the greater the concentration) has increased from 198 in 1991 to 314 in 2015. Indeed, the Herfindahl indices and the Gini coefficients have increased across almost all industrial and service sectors.
3. In some industries such as mining, telecommunications, power generation, private ports and airports, and real estate, the rise in industrial concentration and market dominance has been facilitated by crony capitalism, precisely because these sectors depend upon the use of resources that are the properties of the state. But in many others, that is not the case—such as IT, automobiles, engineering, electrical and transport equipment, capital goods, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, health, hospitality and across a wide array of services, all of which remain intensely competitive and relatively unbeholden to the state. As mentioned earlier, crony capitalism increases market concentration, but not necessarily the other way around. And while genuflecting to politicians is a core attribute of almost all Indian entrepreneurs, this must not be automatically equated to crony capitalism.
4. The ratio of EBITDA to net sales for manufacturing companies has swayed over the period but, in the main, remained relatively flat at around 12.5 per cent. That of firms in the non-financial-services sector have been higher, averaging at 20 per cent of net sales. As mentioned earlier, much of the higher EBITDA margin in services has been on account of India’s IT industry.
5. The RONW of both manufacturing and service-sector firms has oscillated more sharply than the ratio of EBITDA to net sales. After peaking at 47 per cent in FY 2008, manufacturing RONW stood at 16 per cent in FY 2015—a percentage point higher than what it was when the journey was about to begin in FY 1991. Companies engaged in non-financial services have, on average, always earned higher RONW. It peaked at 72 per cent in FY 2008, and stood at a bit below 44 per cent in FY 2015, which still makes it the most profitable service-sector operations in the world. As in the case of EBITDA to net sales, the higher RONW in services is predominantly due to the exceptional performance of IT, BPO and IT-enabled services.
6. Manufacturing companies have kept a tight leash on employee costs, which have remained in the region of 5 per cent to 6 per cent of net sales. These firms have also controlled interest costs which, despite a slight upswing, accounted for a bit over 4 per cent of net sales in FY 2015—not fundamentally different from what it was in FY 1991.
7. Not so the companies engaged in construction and real estate. Their debt-to-equity ratio has soared to unsustainable levels, especially over the last five years. And with it their interest costs which, at almost 13 per cent of net sales, have made almost all of them unviable corporate entities—desperately in need of radical financial restructuring and debt paring.
State-owned Behemoths: Winners and Losers
A noteworthy development over the last twenty-five years has been the spectacular growth of some key SOEs coupled with the increasingly depressing performance of many others. Consider, for FY 2015, the consolidated gross sales of all non-financial-sector companies listed on the BSE. Number one is Indian Oil Corporation. Number three is Hindustan Petroleum Corporation. Number four is Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC). Number seven is Coal India. Number fourteen is Mangalore Refinery. Number fifteen is Gas Authority of India Limited. Number twenty is Steel Authority of India (SAIL). Number twenty-nine is Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL). Number thirty-eight is Metals and Minerals Trading Corporation (MMTC). And number fifty is ONGC Videsh. Together, these ten giants accounted for 23 per cent of the sample’s total gross sales.
  A fact that stares straight in the face is the power of state-sponsored monopolies or oligopolies. Six of these ten SOE giants belong to the oil-and-gas sector, where the firms enjoy immense and unchallenged monopolistic advantages. So, too, in sizeable measure, does MMTC, which, while no longer the sole importer of minerals and metals as it was in the pre-1991 ‘canalized’ regime, is still a giant among importers and the chief supplying agency to other SOEs. Even SAIL operates in an oligopolistic industry, although arguably, its pricing power has diminished because of greater domestic competition coupled with freer imports of steel. As, to a lesser extent, does BHEL, which, despite Chinese and Korean competition, still gets huge orders for boilers and turbines from SOEs in the power sector—both the NTPC and the National Hydro Power Corporation, as well as state-owned power-generating entities.
  Simply put, these state-owned behemoths are where they are because of non-existent or limited competition. In sectors where there are fewer barriers to entry and more flexible scale economies, the share of such SOEs have fallen quite dramatically. An obvious case in point is telecoms, where both Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited (MTNL) and Bharat Sanchar Nigar Limited (BSNL) operate at the fringes compared to private-sector players, only to generate significant losses.
  At the other end of the spectrum are vast numbers of loss-making SOEs that exist because of India’s collective political inability to shut these down. In FY 2015, there were seventy-seven loss-making central-government-owned SOEs (called CPSEs, or central public-sector enterprises, in the official parlance), whose total loss for the year amounted to Rs 27,360 crore.4 These losses, in descending order of magnitude, were: telecommunications (over Rs 11,000 crore in FY 2015), transport services (Rs 2776 crore), consumer goods (Rs 2525 crore), chemicals and pharmaceuticals (Rs 496 crore), textiles (Rs 418 crore), and medium and light engineering (Rs 161 crore). In FY 2015, the two state-owned telecom majors, BSNL and MTNL, incurred losses exceeding Rs 11,125 crore, or 47.6 per cent of the total losses of the loss-making CPSEs. The losses of Air India and its subsidiary, Air India Engineering Services, amounted to Rs 6250 crore, which comprised another 27 per cent of the total losses. The top ten loss-makers accounted for over 85 per cent of the total losses in FY 2015. Among these were firms that have no economic reason for their continued existence such as Hindustan Photo Films, Hindustan Cables, Fertilizers and Chemicals (Travancore) Limited, and Hindustan Fertilizers Corporation Limited.5 Worse still, the accumulated losses of most of these entities have far exceeded their net worth. Consequently, sixty-three loss-making CPSEs are registered with the Board for Industrial Financial Reconstruction, which is still the debt-reorganization body under the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985 (SICA).6
  The pattern is obvious. CPSEs in industries that are natural or state-sponsored monopolies or are sufficiently oligopolistic, earn profits and bequeath much of these as dividends to the cash-strapped central exchequer; they carry glorious titles such as Maharatnas (seven corporations) and Navaratnas (seventeen more). Many of those that were nationalized during the Emergency (1975–77) and in the early to mid-1980s to suit political objectives and belong to competitive industries where they enjoy neither special advantages nor discriminating fiats, have ended up as loss-making entities, often producing little or nothing, such as the nationalized cotton textile and jute mills, and surviving on budgetary doles and existing only to pay the salaries of unionized non-working employees.
  There is an obvious solution for such severely loss-making enterprises that continue to wither on the vine. It involves a combination of liquidating these entities, paying a fair retirement benefit to the workers, and unlocking the value of land so liberated to increase capital investment and help create newer manufacturing entities. This approach was conceived in the Industrial Policy Resolution of 1991 and executed over the next few years by the generous use of voluntary retirement schemes (VRS) under the National Renewal Fund. The extent of surplus labour was huge. In FY 1993, fifty-five sick CPSEs had an estimated 84,283 surplus staff. Of these, almost half were in the nationalized cotton textile and jute mills.7 Between April 1992 and June 1994, 70,826 workers from these CPSEs took VRS, of whom 38,363, or 54 per cent, were from the cotton textile and jute mills.8 By August 1997, another 1,46,663 workers were voluntarily separated.9
  Unfortunately, since the second half of the 1990s, there has been no political will of any party in power to humanely rationalize the excess labour in unprofitable CPSEs. Consequently, government-funded VRS has died its own death. In FY 2015, for instance, only one CPSE was shut down, and the amount earmarked as VRS was totally insufficient to bring about any structural change.
  There has been another major failure regarding the SOEs, which relates to divestment—called ‘disinvestment’ in India. Barring some enthusiasm shown in the NDA regime under Atal Bihari Vajpayee, this has essentially been about selling bits and bobs of the shares of listed, profit-making SOEs, including some of the state-owned banks, to garner non-tax revenue for the central government. Even this has been unsuccessful. As an example, consider the data for the last five years, which is given in Table 4. As is evident, over the period, there has been an average 45 per cent shortfall in achieving the targets. Thus, neither have we as a nation been successful in having efficient insolvency procedures for those that are fit to be shut down; nor have we been able to divest anywhere close to the annual budgetary targets.

The Services–Manufacturing Conundrum
In a regime where ‘Make in India’ is being paraded as a major thrust area in the nation’s manufacturing policy, it is useful to examine where India stands in manufacturing vis-à-vis other comparable nations in Asia and Latin America. Chart I plots data used from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators, 2015 for the year 2014. The vertical axis plots services as a share of GDP and the horizontal does the same for industry (essentially the secondary sector, of which manufacturing is a subset).
  Chart I: The Share of Industry and Services, 2014
 
Source: World Development Indicators, 2015, World Bank.
On the right of Chart I is the cluster of five East and South East Asian nations, which built significant manufacturing capabilities across a large number of sectors and used these to generate export- and investment-driven growth. In all these countries, the share of industry to GDP is significantly higher than India’s: South Korea has higher share of services as well, and Thailand has approximately the same share. In fact, there are four more nations that have higher share of both industry and services vis-à-vis India: the Philippines, Russia, Mexico and Chile. Only four countries have a lower share of industry, though higher of services. These are Brazil, Turkey, Argentina and Bangladesh.
  This raises two fundamental policy questions. First, over the next decade and a half, should India continue on a path where it takes relatively small strides in manufacturing and larger ones in services—to have a composition somewhat akin to the Philippines in Chart I? Second, if we want to predicate higher growth and competitiveness through greater manufacturing as ‘Make in India’ exhorts, and lift the share of industry to around 35 per cent of GDP, what reforms should we earnestly engage in?
  As it stands, it would seem that services will continue to hold the upper hand, primarily because there are far fewer barriers to setting up or expanding myriad service activities throughout India compared to starting new factories. Therefore, in a more laissez-faire state of play, one would expect India (30 per cent industry and 53 per cent services) to drift upwards to where the Philippines is today—that is, about 33 per cent of GDP comprising industry, and 58 per cent services. It is not necessarily a bad thing in a world of increasingly integrated global trade with steadily falling tariffs. For one, services today tend to be more employment-intensive than mining, manufacturing and other industrial activities. For another, there is a vast continuum of scales in services depending upon what these are, and can thus accommodate enterprises ranging from the small to the very large. Besides, these are generally immune to the pressures of lower pricing via global trade and can thus generate decent profits for the service entrepreneurs. However, if increasing the share of manufacturing is to be our credo, then much needs to be done. The next section focuses on some of these issues.
Failure of Physical Infrastructure: Difficulties in Doing Business
Barring the period of the NDA-led government under Atal Bihari Vajpayee (1998–2004) and the first three years of the UPA-I regime under Manmohan Singh (2004–09), India has suffered from an acute failure in jump-starting work on the much-needed physical infrastructure. Things seem to have improved under Narendra Modi, but we have a very long way to go. To understand how poorly off we are, it is useful to compare ourselves with other East and South East Asian nations. Table 5 gives some data.

As the Table shows, only Bangladesh fares worse than India in terms of per capita consumption of electricity. The average Chinese citizen consumes 4.8 times the amount of electricity compared to an Indian; and the average Malaysian 5.9 times. Even Vietnam’s per capita power consumption is 1.7 times that of India’s. Of the eight countries listed in Table 5, only the population of Bangladesh has lower access to electricity versus India. In terms of annual container port traffic, China dwarfs us by a multiple of 15.5. And in logistics performance—data aggregated from responses in World Bank’s Doing Business survey—again, it is only Bangladesh that does worse than us.
  Much more can be said. For instance, we still do not have dedicated, high-speed freight corridors, although two are expected to come into being by the mid-2020s. Regarding national highways, we have a total of 24,900 kilometres that are presently four- and six-laned, of which about 2000 kilometres are tolled expressways. Contrast that with China: it has over 2,65,000 kilometres of highways, of which some 1,40,000 kilometres are expressways.
  To understand how poorly entrepreneurs fare even after twenty-five years of reform, it is useful to glance through India’s scores in the latest Doing Business survey conducted across 189 countries by the World Bank published in June 2016. Table 6 gives the data. The story is pathetic. A quarter century after the advent of economic reforms, 70 per cent of the countries rank higher than us; 9 per cent do better in getting construction permits; 73 per cent are ranked higher in registration of property; 83 per cent face lesser troubles in paying taxes; 94 per cent are better off in enforcing contracts; and 72 per cent rank higher in resolving insolvencies. In a milieu such as this, how does a federal state such as India transform the slogan of ‘Make in India’ to actually produce more in the country?

‘Why Should We Employ Any More?’
The header is a boardroom-level clarion cry across corporate India. It is not an exaggeration. In the last five to seven years, companies throughout India, especially those in manufacturing, have made determined efforts to reduce the labour force. In part, this has been accomplished by not replacing many of those who retire. But, in most cases, it has been to reduce contract labour and to replace them with greater shop-floor efficiencies—by use of more productive machines or by better management of throughput. So too among the sales forces that increasingly use IT and better logistics and warehousing to de-layer levels of employees. The reasons are simple enough.
  First, there is a distinct concern about creating a sense of ‘permanency’. While the Contract Labour Act, 1970, does not explicitly state that contract labourers continuously employed for more than a certain number of days must be made permanent elements of a company’s rolls, labour courts and high courts in various states have often taken a view that it should be such, especially when they believe that the nature of the job is ‘permanent’ and that the contracting arrangements are façades to prevent creating permanent employees. Companies, therefore, are either rotating their contract employees or limiting them to ancillary activities or, as in recent years, replacing such labour with mechanized systems.
  Second, given the absence of adequate flexibility in the employment of labour, especially ‘workmen’, many manufacturing companies have opted for labour-saving computer-numeric-controlled machines and more scientific organization of workflows. Prices of highly efficient versions of such machines are significantly lower today than in the early 1990s; and the benefits are such that, in most cases, wage savings and higher output allow the capital cost to be recouped in a couple of years. Thus, a cotton mill today—be it pure spinning or a composite unit—employs far fewer workers than it would a couple of decades earlier; so too do automobile and auto-ancillary manufacturers, and even traditionally labour-intensive factories that produce garments and piece-goods. This shows up in the employment elasticities.
  The Planning Commission published some disturbing figures a few years ago. Between FY 2000 and FY 2005, employment across various sectors increased by almost 61 million to 457.5 million people. Since then, however, employment growth has dramatically slowed down: between FY 2005 and FY 2010, it grew by merely 2.7 million to reach a total of 460 million. The largest absolute decline in employment was in agriculture, by 15.7 million people, or by 6 per cent of the number employed in 2004–05. The second worst was in manufacturing, down by 7.2 million people, or almost 13 per cent of those employed in 2004–05.10
  More disconcerting is the sharp fall in employment elasticity, or the percentage change in employment for a percentage change in the value added. For all sectors taken together, the employment elasticity has slumped from 0.44 between FY 2000 and FY 2005 to 0.01 in the next quinquennium (FY 2005 to FY 2010). Manufacturing has seen a fall from 0.76 in the first period to –0.31 in the second. In other words, growth in value addition has occurred in the milieu of an absolute decline in employment. So too was the case for agriculture: down from 0.84 to –0.42. What is probably most disturbing, given its share in GDP, is that employment elasticity in services slumped from 0.45 to –0.01.
  Given that most sectors, including manufacturing, are either producing more output with the same or lesser number of persons, the country faces a huge problem of gainfully employing the potential labour supply. The numbers are huge. According to the sixty-eighth round of the National Sample Survey conducted in FY 2012, the ratio of workers to the sample population of men and women (called the worker population ratio, or WPR) was estimated at 0.544 for males and 0.219 for females. Even if these WPRs are held constant over the next two decades, India would still be looking at the need to create additional employment for over 12–15 million workers each year right up to FY 2036.11 How is it going to be possible in a climate of declining or negative employment elasticities? Besides, a growing share of future jobs will need greater literacy, IT and machine skills. Given the state of education and technical training in India, how can one expect even a reasonable percentage of the additional 20 million people seeking jobs each year to have these requisite skills?
  This is a central problem of India’s political economy—an issue that we are resolutely pushing under the carpet, for it is too difficult to comprehend, let alone tackle. It is all too facile to exult about ‘demographic dividend’ in public when we are looking at the face of a demographic and employment nightmare. Somehow, we refuse to come to grips with this central challenge.
The Way Forward
In seminars, when supremely frustrated by poor papers and silly questions, the late Prof. Mrinal Datta Chaudhuri of the Delhi School of Economics used to angrily sputter, ‘Can we stop prefacing sentences with “But in a country like India . . .”’ There is much truth in this. India is a ‘time-series nation’, in that we love comparing ourselves today with ourselves yesterday. Getting a cross-sectional perspective, or how we stand against other comparable nations, is alien to our thought or analysis. The first step in the way forward over the next quarter century is to get away from self-satisfaction and critically examine where we are versus others that matter. Yes, as this chapter has shown, we have accomplished much in the last twenty-five years. Equally, we have relatively achieved far less compared to some other Asian nations and have a very long way to go. To understand this, consider a brief comparison between India and China, culled from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators.
* In 1990, our current dollar per capita GDP adjusted for purchasing-power parity was roughly similar to China’s. By 2014, ours had risen to $6009 and China’s to $14,239, 2.4 times that of India’s.
* Even after scaling down, China’s gross capital formation stands at 46 per cent of GDP. Ours at 30 per cent, 16 percentage points lesser with a far lower base.
* China’s adult-literacy rate for males and females is 95 per cent; ours is 69 per cent. China’s adult-literacy rate for females is 93 per cent; ours is 59 per cent.
* 100 per cent of the population of China has access to electricity versus 78.7 per cent in India.
* The quality, quantity and efficiency of physical infrastructure in China is significantly, almost incomparably, superior to India’s—be these railways, highways, expressways or ports.
* China’s share of industry in GDP is almost 43 per cent; ours is 30 per cent.
* We are ranked 130th out of 189 countries in the index of ease of doing business. China, which is no Singapore by a long shot, is ranked 84th.
One can continue in this vein for much longer, but the limited list suffices to prove the point. It also suggests a way forward.
  For the next decade or two, let us use China as our comparator in matters relating to industrial development and GDP growth. If we do so, let us then ask the following questions:
1. What investments and managerial practices do we need in order to increase the rate of building sustainable six-lane highways to at least 50 km per day?
2. How do we ensure that every home, factory and office gets electricity 24x7 at tariff rates that ensure financial and operational sustainability for the providers of power?
3. How quickly can we create a railway infrastructure that rapidly and efficiently carries goods between factories and ports?
4. How and in what ways can we dramatically increase the scope, scale and quality of technical training across India so that young men and women above eighteen get the skills needed to be attractive to an increasingly digitized workplace?
5. How do we ensure that ‘Make in India’ becomes more than a conveniently worded slogan?
6. How do we recalibrate our public expenses so that the government spends more on creating income-earning and income-supporting capital goods than the hoary subsidies for the relatively better off?
7. When will we have a properly working bankruptcy-resolution process that quickly intervenes to help those firms that can be restructured, and even more rapidly intervenes to accelerate the process of insolvency and winding up?
There are other tasks as well, especially in the social and educational sectors without which we cannot expect to have a ‘future-ready’ workforce. None of these is easy. But each can be achieved. If the polity of a nation called India believes that the next twenty-five years is ours to win, it can do so. Not perfectly. But in large measure. Otherwise, we will have to remain content by saying how well we have done compared to 1991, just as we are with a silver and a bronze medal in the 2016 Olympics.

Animal Spirits: Stray Thoughts on the Nature of Entrepreneurship in India’s Business Families after Liberalization
Gita Piramal
A comparison between the top fifty business families in pre-liberalized 1990 and liberalized 2016 reveals just how sharply reforms impacted the nature of entrepreneurship in India’s business families. Knowledge-based businesses and consumer-facing companies seized the lead from traditional agriculture-based industries such as cotton textile mills, sugar refineries and tea plantations.
‘[It is] characteristic of human nature that a large proportion of our positive activities depend on spontaneous optimism rather than on a mathematical expectation . . . our decisions to do something positive, the full consequences of which will be drawn out over many days to come, can only be taken as a result of animal spirits—of a spontaneous urge to action rather than inaction . . . if the animal spirits are dimmed and the spontaneous optimism falters, enterprise will fade and die.’
—John Maynard Keynes, British economist (1883–1946)
Creative Destruction
‘The opening up of new markets, foreign or domestic, and the organizational development . . . incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one. This process of Creative Destruction is the essential fact about capitalism. It is what capitalism consists in and what every capitalist concern has got to live in.’
—Joseph A. Schumpeter, Austrian-American economist (1883–1950)
In Greek mythology, Cassandra was a princess blessed with the gift of foreseeing the future but cursed in that no one believed her. Possibly, it was not one of Virenchee Sagar’s and Manhar Bhagat’s brighter ideas to name a group company ‘Cassandra Investments Ltd’ instead of a variant of ‘Nirlon Synthetic Fibres and Chemicals’.
  The months before Cassandra Investments was incorporated (1984) were the high point of the two entrepreneurs’ careers. For twenty years, Nirlon made nylon textile yarn in a plant off the Mumbai highway. The future seemed to have suddenly perked up as the government showered Nirlon with approvals for technical collaborations. Letters of intent that had been gathering dust were rapidly converted into licences. Sagar and Bhagat began building factories in Roha, Raigad district, and Tarapur, Thane district, both in Maharashtra. In 1985, the two entrepreneurs proudly announced the twenty-second consecutive year of a dividend payout, acquiring blue-chip status.
  A few days later, the Rajiv Gandhi administration announced the New Textile Policy, 1985, liberalizing production, enabling technology upgradation and offering tax concessions. The tide turned suddenly but not for the better for the two business families with sons and daughters waiting in the wings. Competition, a force unfamiliar to Nirlon’s management, began applying pressure on the bottom line. The half-built factories became a drain on their resources. Sagar and Bhagat sought to balance the now with the future but the ‘1985–87 unrealised expansion plans during turbulent times for the Indian Synthetic Textile Industry led to losses and an erosion of net worth’, records Nirlon dolefully in its milestones.
  The 1985 reforms were like a playful breeze fronting the gale unleashed by the P.V. Narasimha Rao administration in 1991. Liberalization released animal spirits in business families. They reacted by growing, slowing, expanding, morphing or imploding.
  Roughly 6000 companies were incorporated between 1992 and 1996 by family business groups. Many were launched by first-time entrepreneurs, but the data show a fair number of re-energized business families aggressively pushing existing businesses or entering new domains.
  A comparison between the top fifty business families in pre-liberalized 1990 and liberalized 2016 reveals just how sharply reforms impacted the nature of entrepreneurship in India’s business families. Knowledge-based businesses and consumer-facing companies seized the lead from traditional agriculture-based industries such as cotton textile mills, sugar refineries and tea plantations.
  During this quarter century, 72 per cent of the business families that dominated the pre-liberalization period completely drop out of the list. A different set of 70 per cent enter (family splits account for the small difference between exits and entrants). First-generation entrepreneurs make up 36 per cent of the 2016 top fifty list. Another 34 per cent are second generation.
  Only fifteen hardy business families survive the challenges of change. The Birlas, the Ambanis and the Tatas remain on top for the entire quarter century under discussion. Only two business families—Tata and Bajaj—maintain the same rank throughout this period. We will explore the challenge of longevity later in this essay.
  A full list of India’s top fifty business houses in 1990 and mid-2016 appears in Annex 1. Special mention needs to be made of two categories of unlisted companies missing in this essay. The first category is composed of established multigenerational business families who see no reason to list. Parsi groups curiously lead the corps. The Shapoorji Pallonji Group is one of India’s leading construction companies with seventy-seven operational privately held active companies. Unlisted Godrej & Boyce&, a diversified industrial conglomerate led by Jamshyd Godrej, is an important missing firm from this survey as is Cyrus Poonawalla’s Serum Institute.
  Companies not yet quite ready for initial public offering (IPO) comprise the second category. Over the last decade, Chandru Raheja and his sons, Neel and Ravi, have founded up to fifteen candidates for listing. Other pre-IPO stage potentials include Flipkart and Snapdragon, firms established by the GVK and GMR groups respectively, as well as the infra companies Anil Ambani promoted around 2008. Leena Tewari’s USV, a diabetes-focused pharma, may be another company-in-waiting. These represent the tip of the iceberg.
  A brief glance at the activities of the first- and second-generation throws up some interesting differences. First, the pharmaceuticals sector dominates both lists. The second, and perhaps the most important, difference between the two groups, is that the first-generation group launched several consumer-facing businesses, while many in the second-generation group demonstrate a continuation of manufacturing traditions.
  Who in the days of the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices (MRTP) would have thought that homely offerings such as batteries and healing balm, television programmes, text messages and toothpaste tubes would translate into billion-dollar companies? Several first-generation entrepreneurs were able to introduce attractive product offerings, establish pan-India brands and pan-India availability. The rapidity, scale and success of this entrepreneurship is as extraordinary as was the journey of Lever Brothers in the colonial era.
  Banking, telecommunications and Internet networks provided the critical backbone for these first-generation business families. Equally important was the logistics revolution that followed liberalization, as interstate borders became easier to navigate. Newcomers such as Gati and older firms such as Patel Roadways expanded road and air transport, and invested in warehousing and IT solutions. GDP growth combined with good monsoons in the post-liberalization era enabled higher per capita income, which kicked in consumer spending. Given the size of India’s population, if a brand catches the aam admi’s attention, sales follow.

Table 1 throws up an interesting facet of entrepreneurship in India’s business families. ‘Like father, like son’ is a common cliché. Here, we see that at least 12 per cent of the first-generation entrepreneurs in our sample appear to be inspired by their fathers. Anil Aggarwal’s father, Dwarka Prasad, made a modest living by making aluminium conductors in Patna (Bihar). Dilip Shanghvi’s father, Shantilal, was a trader of bulk pharma products in Kolkata. Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw’s father, Rasendra Mazumdar, was head brewmaster at United Breweries. Radhe Shyam Agarwal’s father, Bansilal, had a shop in Kolkata’s Burrabazar, selling women’s cosmetics. Rahul Bhatia’s father, Kapil, was a travel agent. Shashikant Ruia’s father, Nand Kishore, had a shipping and exports business in Madras, as the city was called in 1956. Most of these fathers were either content with what they did or, in a few cases, failed to make a name, fame and financial success in their chosen profession. But their experiences seemed to have egged on their children to expand and grow in the same sectors.
  The post-liberalization first-generation entrepreneurs are likely, in the fullness of profits and progeny, to bloom into business families. We have to wait and watch which daughters and sons have the talent and business skills, but it would be natural to assume that there is a decent line of business families waiting in the wings to edge into the elite ranking of India’s top fifty as soon as one falls off it and a place opens up. And if it is easy to slide down the ladder, it is also easier today to move up the ladder. Interestingly, Anil Agarwal, a first-generation entrepreneur in the prime of his life, has announced that he won’t leave the businesses he established to his children. But what about the children of the second generation? Will they become another statistic buttressing the cliché of ‘clogs to clogs in three generations’? Or will they consolidate and strengthen the companies they will inherit? Or will they participate in and grow with future opportunities?
  Time will tell.
  Table 2 distils the second-generation entrepreneurs from Annex 1. Here, we see that while services crowd Table 1, Table 2 has a decidedly manufacturing bias. As in Table 1, the pharmaceutical sector is as attractive to the second-generation as to the first-generation, but the auto sector (Hinduja, Munjal and Kalyani) has its own appeal.

In the next section, we take a closer look at some of the reasons behind the failure of business families.
The Challenge of Consistence Performance
  ‘In a deregulated, competitive economy driven by the cruel logic of markets, a company that fails to change fast enough can and will die—as is manifest in the slow march to extinction that has already become inevitable for some of India’s great old companies . . . Why then do managers not see how poor their performance is compared to that of their key competitors? The answer is very simple. It lies in a corporate disease called satisfactory underperformance. It is a pervasive disease—we have confronted it in companies all over the world. It is a disease that is very easy to catch—indeed, finding a way to avoid it is the unnatural act.’
—Sumantra Ghoshal, Euroguru (1948–2004)
My co-author, the late Sumantra Ghoshal, and I wrote these words in our book, Managing Radical Change—What Indian Companies Must Do To Remain World-Class. The pathology of ‘satisfactory underperformance’ is widely prevalent in India. In many business families, top management feels that everything is going fine when actually the organization is not fine at all. Top management blinkers itself to changing economic and competitive situations. A slow but steady decline in financials is brushed off, claiming it to be temporary when it is not. Outdated, slow-moving products or services with declining profitability and generating long tails become drags on the company, but top management is reluctant to cull the products, recommending instead that even if these products are not selling in big numbers, they still bring in some revenues on depreciated assets.
  In this cocooning, what is lost is the urgency to find great new products or services to serve a newly liberalized India with a young population. Managers take their cues from promoters, searching for the convictions and passions that lie behind the emails, speeches and planning sessions. When managers discover platitudes instead of true aspirational leadership, what chances can managers have of leading change in their own organizations?
  The Nirlon case, with which this essay opens, is a classic example of the pathology of satisfactory underperformance. Content with the super profits from a protected business, the patriarchs of the two business families were unable to cope with the changes in the regulatory environment.
  The evidence from Annex 1 leaves no doubt that many business families had, and continue to have, trouble shifting mental attitudes and organizational gears. In contrast, Table 7 provides examples of some business families that have not allowed this addictive pathology to overwhelm them. Yet, I am beginning to wonder what other factors, beyond the pathology of satisfactory underperformance, lie behind the recent sharp decline in some business families.
  The traditional arguments offered for the failure of a business family are:
* a business family seeks to be a challenger but cannot match incumbents;
* a business family becomes a shooting star because its steady performance plods behind rising stars pushing upwards;
* a technology tweak makes uneconomic a business family’s operations;
* inheritors fail to grow the family firm, either because of lack of talent or interest; and
* a family split is often the last straw.
A classic case study is the Mafatlal group, where all five factors listed above came into play with disastrous effect. The group was founded by Mafatlal Gagalbhai (1873–1944) when he acquired a small, defunct cotton textile mill in Ahmedabad in 1905. By 1930, the group was running nine cotton textile mills, had fingers in insurance, retail, financial services, textile trading and, for brief moments, a jute mill and a shipping company. The group’s most ambitious foray was in petrochemicals, and in 1963, it pioneered NOCIL, a project large enough for Time magazine to fly a reporter from New York to Bombay (as Mumbai was then known). By the 1990s, however, low investments in technology, product development and HR practices for their core businesses sapped the Mafatlal group’s textile business. NOCIL became a pigmy in front of the Ambanis’ Reliance group. The inheritors were unable to leapfrog into the future. Internecine family dynamics further contributed to the group’s decline.
  But is there something deeper to explore beyond the pathology of satisfactory underperformance and the traditional five arguments for the decline of business families? Did liberalization contribute to the debacle of seven business families sliding down the ranks and thirty-six families falling off completely between 1990 and 2016 from the list of top fifty business families as Table 3 divulges? If so, how?

The New Economic Policy was a radical intervention by the P.V. Narasimha Rao administration. New technologies create new markets; the IT sector is an example. A series of generous monsoons enabled the opening up of the rural economy as the sharp growth of the FMCG (fast moving consumer goods) sector shows. When per capita income rose, so did consumer spending; the entry of global giants such as Amazon into India confirms this trend. The lifting of trade barriers enabled exports, the pharmaceutical sector, for example. Once the state allowed entrepreneurs to borrow in global markets, animal spirits led to a rash of international acquisitions.
  However, it would be facile to fall into these apparently logical traps to explain what really happened post-liberalization. It would also be facile to jump to the conclusion that old business families fell of the cliff and disappeared.
  One, as new business families thrust their way upwards, the old ones dropped down the rankings, and several continue to function today. Two, most companies survived, often because they were acquired by fresh blood. A few continue to linger in pain: it’s not easy to close down a company in India. Some companies morphed under the old managements. This made many old business families profitable but not necessarily at par with their golden-age era. Mumbai’s old textile mill industry is an example where real-estate uses diversified. We see very few examples of companies actually imploding.
  An additional answer to the question of why business families failed possibly lies in the new pace of churn that we are beginning to see today, and the challenge of consistent performance.
  Annex 1 reveals that the most hectic activity—both upwards and downwards—takes place towards the lower half of the top fifty league. This is the arena where incumbents or newcomers thrust themselves upwards, pushing weaker incumbents downwards. The phenomenon is not unique to India and is mirrored in several countries, including in developed economies.
  However, churn today has changed enormously from pre-liberalization years, making the challenge of consistent performance very much harder. The pace of slipping and sliding, or flourishing and climbing has become much, much faster. Rankings have become much more fluid than they used to be, with business families moving up and slipping down on a yearly basis instead of decades.

Chart 1 illustrates the point. Its compiler, Mint’s Prabhat Singh analyses companies, but the approach is a useful proxy for business families. The table depicts how after liberalization, it became much harder for a company to remain in the top fifty list of companies for any significant amount of time.
India on the World Map
‘Enterprise which depends on hopes stretching into the future benefits the community as a whole.’
—John Maynard Keynes, British economist (1883–1946)
For Dr Yusuf Khwaja Hamied (b. 1936), vindication came just in time. Or ten years late. It depends on which side of the line you stand. Ten years late because thousands died during a 1990s global AIDS epidemic, who could have lived had their governments allowed them access to Triomune, Cipla’s low-cost drug for AIDS. Just in time because results of the open clinical trial conducted in a developing country (Cameroon) were published on 3 July 2004, exactly 180 days before TRIPS1 would kick in on 1 January 2005.
  Working in his Goa and Mumbai laboratories, Hamied had discovered the efficacy of a combination of nevirapine, stavudine and lamivudine—three generic drugs—packed into a single tablet, taken twice a day. Hamied began reverse engineering AIDS drugs in 1992, because he realized the epidemic would hit India hard. ‘Lamivudine took four years of my life,’ he told the New York Times. Hamied’s talent for chemistry was spotted in 1953 by Lord Alexander Robertus Todd (1907–1997). Todd, who would earn a Nobel Prize in 1957, took the Mumbaikar under his wing, inviting the teenager to Cambridge University’s Christs College in 1954.
  Triomune was effective. It was cheap. And it challenged incumbents, in particular, America’s giant multinationals with their expensive, entrenched brands.
  In September 2000, Hamied spoke at a conference of European Union health ministers and chief executives of major pharmaceutical multinationals, and quietly dropped a bombshell. He proposed plans for producing the HIV cocktail for $800 per person per year, a fraction of the $14,000 being charged by the multinationals. He went further. ‘Cipla will give technical know-how to any government of the developing countries who wish to produce their own HIV drugs . . . we will give the drug that stops the transmission of HIV from mother to child totally free,’ he announced. ‘You could hear the breath being sucked out of the room,’ reported UK’s Guardian.
  Hamied pushed prices down further. On 7 February 2001, the New York Times front page blazed ‘Indian Company Offers AIDS Cocktail at a Dollar a Day’. ‘My life has not been the same since then,’ Hamied admitted to Tarun Khanna, a professor at the Harvard Business School. ‘I want to make this very clear, despite what the multinationals say, I abide by the laws of the country in which I do business. I am not against patents; I am against monopolies.’
  This was the spirit that shaped the India Patents Act, 1970, which took effect in 1972. Instead of recognizing product patents, India reserved protection for process patents. But the World Trade Organization came into existence on 1 January 1995 and along with it came TRIPS (Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights). Like many developing nations, India initially opposed TRIPS but eventually agreed to make its patent laws TRIPS-compliant by 1 January 2005. This situation gave pharma techpreneurs a ten-year window to grow its scientific and technological base. By 2015, India was the world’s third-largest producer of affordable generic drugs. Hamied and Cipla breasted the deadline with mere days to go.

In a country where business, economics, politics and the state rarely mesh, the pharmaceutical industry is perhaps one of the few sectors where players share a common ultimate goal even where there are differences over how to get there. Table 4 outlines the symbiotic relationship between policy and pharma company incorporations in India’s business families. Table 5 describes the tremendous achievement of Indian pharma in the world. A small footnote: during his restructuring of the Tata group in the 1990s, Ratan Tata sold off the pharma companies. In hindsight, was that a good or poor decision?

The fine performance of these pharma companies has the unfortunate upshot of training a spotlight on the paucity of world-class and world-size Indian family-run multinationals. True, the Tata group’s global footprint spans more than 100 countries in six continents, and in 2014–15 it had impressive international revenues of $73.4 billion, but like GE, the group is an aggregation of companies. Unlike GE, the Tata firms still have some way to go before gaining global leadership status. The small size of the Indian market is a critical inhibiting factor. Reliance is a juggernaut, but the focus of the Ambanis is India, and the Indian market so far is too small for the creation of truly global giants in the sectors they are in.
The Future of Indian Business Families
‘Before the multinational corporation, there was family business. Before the industrial revolution, there was family business. Before the enlightenment of Greece and the empire of Rome, there was family business.’
—William T. O’Hara, American business historian (2004)
‘After half a century, and this is an overestimation, no one will talk about family businesses in India.’
—Dwijendra Tripathi, Indian business historian (2011)
I am a firm believer in the O’Hara school of thought. But the views of India’s foremost business historian, my mentor and PhD guide, Dwijendra Tripathi, cannot be taken lightly. In an interview published in Mint, Tripathi highlights four areas of strain in business families that have been exacerbated by liberalization:
* Greater availability of business opportunities is testing the ability of business families to manage bigger markets and more complex organizations;
* The family is no longer the primary financier for businesses. Many sources of funding businesses are now available;
* The persistence of the third-generation syndrome, i.e., the point when a business family breaks up;
* The fading of the joint family system. Emotional bonds today are not as strong as in earlier generations.
Tripathi closes by quoting Alfred D. Chandler, the American business historian. Referring to General Motors, Chandler wrote: ‘No family or family institution was large enough to staff the managerial hierarchies required to administer modern multi-unit enterprises. Because the salaried manager developed specialized knowledge, and because their enterprises were able to generate funds necessary for expansion, they ultimately took over the top-level decisionmaking from owners, financiers or their financiers. Family members, as a result, came to view their enterprises as rentors . . .’ ‘This holds true for Indian businesses as well,’ Tripathi commented.
  With the exception of the fifth point—where only time can tell, and the time may not come for many decades, if at all—Tripathi’s views are valid. Liberalization did usher in more opportunities. There are many more funding options today. The third-generation syndrome does play out, but we now know there are ways to channel it. Humans are emotional beings. That will never change. I am an optimist and believe India offers tremendous opportunities for business families, current and unborn.
  For a moment, let’s go back in history. Table 6 was compiled backwards, i.e., tracing the roots of the top fifty business families of 2016. Mumbai’s Wadias are the oldest business family in this grouping. Established in 1735 by Lovji Wadia, knighted by the British for services to the Raj, it has morphed over 280 years from building ships to baking bread and biscuits. All the Marwari families mentioned in Table 6 (Birla, Bangur, Bajaj and Piramal) have split, some more often than others, yet continue to contribute a family member to the list. In the course of making Ayurvedic products for over a century, the Burmans have managed to develop a relatively smooth succession planning process that works. A loose–tight structure knits the Godrejs and the TVS group. Tight through the joint selection of the group chairman (usually, the eldest family member) and keeping each other informed of important decisions through cross-directorships of boards. Loose as business operations are independent of each other. At the Hamieds, it is a work in progress.
The list of business houses mentioned in Table 6 is extracted from Annex 1, which is to be considered as a snapshot in time. Markets change continuously, and as the market caps of the companies under their charge fluctuate, so do the rankings of business families. Those featured here are here because of the total market cap of the companies under their control during the fortnight between 1 June 2016 and 16 June 2016. India has many more vintage business families than Table 6 suggests. They happened to not make into the top fifty that fortnight.

  Unfortunately, lack of space precludes a deeper examination of the ways in which these vintage business families have defied the three-generation syndrome. The ways in which newer business families manage in-house talent and succession planning will also have to be reserved for another time and place. Perhaps the key for both lies in an ability to straddle tradition and modernity. Food for thought, but for another time and place. In the meantime, a summary of the top fifty by generation in Table 7.

The State
‘What are we seeking to control and for what purpose? Where have we gone wrong and why?’ pondered Rabindra Kishen Hazari (1932–86), idealist, economist and, in the mid-1960s, Jawaharlal Nehru’s key architect of industrial licensing and the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission.
  Manmohan Singh (b. 1932), idealist, economist and, in the early 1990s, P.V. Narasimha Rao’s finance minister, who implemented the New Economic Policy and the dismantling of the MRTP Commission, may possibly be asking himself the same question.
  According to a 2011 Credit Suisse report, India has the highest percentage share of family businesses in Asia, accounting for 67 per cent of the total listed companies with a market capitalization of over $50 million (3.35 billion). But what about the future?
  While I believe in the future of business families, two concerns need to be addressed: the slowing of company incorporations in the private sector; and the seepage of talent to the rest of the world.
  As mentioned earlier, roughly 6000 companies were incorporated by large family business groups in the heady early days of liberalization when everything seemed possible. But the picture changes far too quickly. Chart 2 shows the peaks and valleys of non-government-firm incorporation between 1989–90 and 2105–16.
  Enthusiasm and hope led to an uptick between 1992–93 and 1995–96 when 1,34,507 non-government companies were promoted. By 2001–02, we are back to 21,000+ levels. The slowdown between 1996–2003 is sharp but a steady and stable GDP, enabled by a series of good monsoons, allows the number of incorporations to start rising. The year 2011–12 was the best, with 99,587 new non-government companies being launched.
  Chart 2 captures the optimism of the past. It also points to the current insecurity about the future. Company incorporations are falling, and the sharpest fall is taking place in new companies launched by the large business families. The real picture will become clearer after the company results of 2018–19 are out, but roughly only about 200 important new companies have been launched by major family business groups over the past couple of years. For a country the size of India, that’s like a population of 1.3 billion winning two medals in the Rio Olympics.
  The second challenge is that talent is leaving India. In the brain drain of the 1960s, India lost scientists to the West, particularly the United States with their well-funded, high-quality laboratories. The current exodus of entrepreneurship is even more insidious, and harmful to the future of India.
  Second- and third-generation members of business families, particularly those in their thirties, are becoming increasingly uneasy with India’s ever-changing regulatory environment. Despite liberalization, the relationship between business and politics is as fragile as it has always been. Disenchanted with the system, a worrying number secretly dream of either leaving India and starting afresh in other parts of the world, or of selling their operations to become capital allocators rather than actual managers.
  Their conversations are a reprise of Aditya Birla’s (1943–55), who looked outside India for growth opportunities. ‘So much time was being taken up that I decided to move out,’ he said. ‘Everyone wants to make his own contribution and whatever I might do in India would only be a drop in the ocean. Going overseas was the only course I had to make it on my own.’
  Disenchantment is not limited to business families but has spread to professional managers who run operations. In fact, managers have pre-empted young inheritors: it is an open secret that over the last five years, India has lost almost 200 of its best senior-level managers to Singapore.
  Every single company in the world starts life as a dream. The dream of a restless entrepreneur. But in the end, it is the state, the government and its policies that decide the forms entrepreneurship can take.

A Comment on the Data
(1) The list of companies controlled by a business family was compiled from a variety of sources, including, but not limited to, government records, Bombay Stock Exchange, CMIE Prowess, moneycontrol.com, bseindia.com, Bloomberg, corporate annual reports, company websites and other company documents, as well as books and media reports.
(2) Only listed companies have been considered for ranking purposes. The base dates are 31 March 2015 for companies listed on the BSE and 1–16 June 2016 for companies’ market capitalization.
(3) Strictly speaking, the data for 1990 and 2016 are not comparable, but using the popular yardsticks of the times enables a picture of trends as they were at the various points in time. In the controlled economy that was 1964–91, assets as a measure of a business family’s success was probably the purest criteria as the government monitored the results continuously. In post-liberalization era, market capitalization instantly becomes the criteria of success as managements are rated by their nimbleness and ability to manage change.
(4) Where a company has a foreign subsidiary and its financials are included in the consolidated statement, its contribution is automatically captured in the company’s market capitalization.

India’s National Innovation System: Transformed or Half-formed?
Naushad Forbes
This chapter has benefited greatly from the expert support of Janak Nabar and his team at the Centre for Technology, Innovation and Economic Research, Pune, and Digvijay Bhandari at Forbes Marshall. The comments of Rakesh Mohan on an earlier draft are much appreciated.
Indian industry has changed beyond recognition in the twenty-five years since the reforms. From operating in a protected home market, often producing old designs of indifferent quality in sector after sector, there are now no product gaps between what is available in India and what is available in the rest of the world. We take this for granted today, but in 1991, as an affluent Indian, I was fortunate to buy a new car only ten years out of date (replacing my old new car, which was twenty-five years out of date). I bought most of my clothes overseas; no decent cheese or processed food was available in the country; we booked phone lines five years ahead of when we thought we might need them; our one domestic airline—Indian Airlines—published its timetable for the sole purpose of enabling you to calculate how late you were; and television consisted (on Doordarshan) of picking between the news and a stimulating programme on animal husbandry. Contrast that with 2016, when what we enjoy in each large Indian city is at par with most large international cities. (And if you take a flight today from New York or London to Mumbai or Delhi, you leave a Third-World airport and arrive at a First-World one.)
  India’s product and service markets have been transformed in the last twenty-five years. Has India’s innovation system been similarly transformed? If you are a macroeconomist, the answer is ‘no’. If you are a microeconomist, the answer is ‘maybe’, ‘somewhat’. In brief, the macro-innovation data shows no or modest change in the proportion of GDP spent on R & D, in who spends on R & D and in where it is done. There is some change in the sectors where R & D effort is concentrated. The import of technology shows rapid change. The individual firm story too is one of rapid change. In particular, a focus on learning has completely changed what products are made and how often new products are introduced. The basis of survival has dramatically changed the efficiency with which firms operate. Let us flesh out this picture of half-formation rather than transformation. I will focus on learning and R & D, leaving the discussion of changes in the higher-education system, trade policy, business and manufacturing to the specialized chapters in this book. I end with a discussion of what we must do to move from this half-formed National Innovation System (NIS) to one that is transformed. In particular, I argue that India’s unusual1 pattern of specialization in skill-intensive and capital-intensive manufacturing demands much more investment in innovation than currently happens.
1. A Few Building Blocks to Understand Technical Capability, R & D and Innovation
The importance of technical capability in economic growth is well recognized. From the very first growth-accounting exercises of the 1950s for the US economy,2 through analyses of Japan, South Korea and Taiwan in their catch-up stories, to China today, technical change is estimated to account for over half of all economic growth.3 Technical change shows up in the economy as ‘innovation’, as doing new things for commercial advantage. Innovation largely happens in firms, which must be at the heart of any such analysis. The innovative capacity of firms is affected by both what they do themselves and the institutions around them. The education system provides skilled labour, engineers and researchers. Where publicly funded research is done affects how it connects with industry. Public policy can provide incentives for investing in R & D, either directly or through patents. The trade regime can foster local production and/or an outward mindset. The culture of entrepreneurship affects investment in different kinds of capabilities. And broader cultural factors can influence how entrepreneurs define what is good. A framework of an NIS brings these factors together.4 It enables a more systematic comparison across countries of the drivers of technical capability. Although R & D is the most studied component of innovation, it is good to always keep in mind that innovation—defined as ‘something new for commercial advantage’—is a much broader concept and applies to all firms in all sectors. Innovation matters as much to a garment firm introducing a new design or a start-up launching a local-transport app (activities that rarely involve R & D as a formal activity done by dedicated technical staff, but are still highly innovative) as to a pharmaceutical firm developing a better cure for a disease involving years of research. R & D is, however, the most directly connected with the study of innovation, so we focus our analysis there.
1.1. R & D is Highly Concentrated
R & D is hugely concentrated worldwide. Most R & D is done in a handful of countries: of a total of around $1.5 trillion spent on global R & D in 2014–15, the top five countries accounted for 66 per cent, with industrial R & D at 71 per cent of the total.5 It is highly concentrated in a few industries: the top five industries—pharmaceuticals, automobiles, technology hardware, software and electronics account for 68 per cent of the total of industrial R & D. And within those industries, it is highly concentrated in a few companies: the top twenty companies account for 21 per cent of global industrial R & D, the top 300 companies for 67 per cent.6
1.2. India As an Outlier in R & D Spending
  Table 1: R & D As a Percentage of GDP over Time in Leading Newly Industrializing Countries (NICs)7

  
Source: For data from 1980–96, see UNESCO Statistical Yearbook (1999); for data on China, India, Mexico, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand and Brazil (pre-2000), see UNESCO Institute of Statistics (various years), http://data.uis.unesco.org/; for data on Brazil (2000–14), see World Development Indicators (various years), http://data.worldbank.org/; 2014, author’s estimate.
Table 1 shows that India was an early investor in R & D, with R & D as a percentage of GDP being higher than for countries that were considerably richer at that point in time. However, India’s investment in R & D has stagnated over the last thirty years, ranging between 0.6 and 0.9 per cent of GDP, while South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, China and, to some extent, Brazil have substantially increased their investments. Mexico and Thailand (and Malaysia and Indonesia, as other leading NICs) reflect much more subdued investment in R & D throughout this period.
  Table 2: Who Does the R & D?

  
Source: UNESCO Institute for Statistics (various years), http://data.uis.unesco.org; Department of Science and Technology, India, Research and Development Statistics at a Glance, 2011–12; Author’s calculations and estimates based on 2010–14 data; Centre for Technology, Innovation and Economic Research.
Table 2 shows that the bulk of R & D spending worldwide happens in firms (around 71 per cent of the total). The balance is publicly funded research, most of it done in universities (17 per cent), with a smaller share in autonomous R & D institutes (12 per cent).8 India is an outlier on three counts.
a) First, the share of industry in the total national R & D is the lowest of any major economy at 35 per cent.9 This share was 25 per cent in 1991, so the rise (of a rapidly growing GDP) is significant but not dramatic, and keeps India an outlier. The split of industrial R & D in India has changed significantly: in 1991, the 25 per cent industry share split into 15 per cent private-sector industry and 10 per cent public-sector industry; today, the 35 per cent industry share splits into 30 per cent private-sector industry and 5 per cent public-sector industry.10
b) Second, publicly funded R & D in India at 65 per cent is the highest among all major economies. China’s used to be high as well but, in this same period, has seen the publicly funded share fall to 16 per cent (from 50 per cent in 199111).
c) Third, where publicly funded R & D is done is again dramatically different in India. The bulk of public R & D (over 90 per cent) is done by the government in its own autonomous R & D institutes. A small share of publicly funded R & D (< 10 per cent of the public share) is done within the university system, giving the Indian higher-education sector the lowest share of national R & D (4 per cent) of any major economy.
1.3. Publicly Funded Research and Industrial Innovation
The popular mental construct of the relationship between scientific research and industrial innovation is simple: scientific research leads to discoveries that permit the development of new technology, and this new technology leads to into production and the market. This mental model, referred to in the literature as the linear model of innovation,12 is attractively simple but also simplistic. Over the last fifty years, the work of Kenneth Arrow, Paul David, Stephen Kline, Richard Nelson, Keith Pavitt, Nathan Rosenberg and Derek de Solla Price have greatly enriched our understanding of the true—and quite limited—role that scientific research plays in industrial innovation.
  Price showed some fifty years ago that new scientific discoveries appear in industrial innovation with a typical lag of some twenty-five years. As such, an understanding of old scientific findings is adequate for most industrial innovation. This understanding of old scientific research is usually fully captured in course teaching, which leads one to the conclusion that science education matters much more to most industrial innovation than new scientific research.
  Indeed, far from being the dominant source of industrial innovation, new scientific research matters globally to industrial innovation in just two exceptional cases. First, advances in certain fields, such as biotechnology and semiconductors, have close connections with scientific research. Second, there is a broader role for scientific research as one of ‘technology’s wellsprings’—to reinvigorate technical progress in a particular field.13 This ‘reinvigoration’ typically takes the form of a new technological paradigm for industry—online music taking over from compact discs, say, or the jet engine from the propeller. As Nelson puts it:
There is persuasive evidence that in many industries technological advance is what Winter and I have called cumulative, in the sense that today’s new technology not only provides enhanced operational capabilities but serves as a starting point for tomorrow’s efforts to further advance technology. Science may be involved as well, but in most industries science seems to be tapped as a body of general knowledge relevant to problem solving, with ‘new’ findings not playing a special role. Where new science is not particularly important, a steady flow of newly minted scientists and engineers suffices to keep the laboratory adequately up to date with the world of public science.14
1.4. But What about India?
So research is critical to technical advancement in science-based industries and to the innovation of new technological paradigms. The results of research can be appropriated by other firms and indeed by other countries. Only when particular industries, such as semiconductors in Korea and Taiwan or cars in Korea, approach the technological frontier is there a case for scientific research itself, and hence for publicly subsidizing it. Scientific research should be seen, then, as the follower, not the leader, of industrial activity. Keith Pavitt made just this point:
. . . national technological activities are significant determinants of national economic performance as measured by productivity and economic growth. But what about the causal links between developments in national science and in national technology? Do they run from a national science base that creates the ideas and discoveries that the national technology system can exploit? Or do they run from the national technology system that creates both demands on—and resources for—the national science system? Our reading of the (imperfect) evidence . . . is that the causal links run from the national technology system to the national science system.15
1.5. Where Should Publicly Funded Research Be Done?
University Research As an End in Itself
Although India was an early investor in scientific research, this investment went overwhelmingly into autonomous scientific research institutions. The end result was that research would bypass the university system, a point long understood everywhere except India.16 For example, the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research encompasses thirty-seven laboratories employing 4000 scientists: assessments of CSIR’s contribution to Indian industry (its reason for existence) have shown little connection with industry. Any attempt to reform the Indian scientific research system that does not address this core issue of combining public research with teaching and not doing it in autonomous research institutions will be fruitless. This lesson is just not being learnt: the Eleventh Plan (2007–12) set up fourteen new autonomous institutes, and the Twelfth Plan (2012–17) proposed seven more. We could at least grandfather the problem and allocate incremental public-research funding to the higher-education sector.
  Combining research and teaching will benefit both. The huge growth in higher technical education in India has all been at the undergraduate level; graduate technical education has stagnated. As the better institutes, and in particular the IITs, attempt to grow their graduate and PhD programmes, a shortage of qualified faculty is becoming increasingly acute. World-class graduate education requires that teachers do research, and unless there is dramatic growth in research, we cannot hope to have world-class graduate education. But the benefits from combining research and teaching would not flow just one way to teaching. Research would benefit too. Thanks to India’s early investment in scientific research, by the 1980s, it had achieved the levels of a medium-sized developed country in the primary measure of science output—publications in scientific journals. But this lead in publications did not show up in patents, often used as a measure of the output of technology research, where Korea and Taiwan have been the big new entrants.
  Learning from Korea and Taiwan, the flow runs sequentially from industrial development to industrial in-house R & D to public scientific research.17 An industrial sector competing with the best firms in the world in increasingly sophisticated industrial sectors is a requirement for sustaining investment in in-house R & D, and strong in-house R & D is a requirement for sustaining investment in public scientific research of value to industry. It is only since 1991 that Indian industry has increasingly had to compete with the world’s leading firms. This has, in turn, driven investment in in-house R & D by specific Indian firms and industries such as pharmaceuticals. The more advanced technological sectors in Indian industry are now capable of utilizing, and therefore sustaining, investment in public scientific research. By combining this research with teaching, the Indian economy will get the primary benefit of doing research: the availability of trained researchers.

Table 3A shows data by sector for the top 2500 R & D spending firms worldwide (who account for over three-quarters of global industrial R & D spending). Note that of twenty-six Indian firms (against 301 Chinese firms and eighty South Korean firms), nineteen are in just three sectors—pharmaceuticals, automobiles and software, and India has no firms in five of the ten top R & D intensive sectors worldwide. Part 1 of the explanation of why industrial R & D in India lags is this absence of several sectors that are R & D intensive.

Tables 3B and 3C provide Part 2 of the explanation: leading Indian firms invest somewhat less in R & D as a percentage of sales than their global counterparts. But a much more dominant explanation than the proportion of sales spent on R & D is the absence of really large R & D spending firms. No Indian firms, for example, figure in the top twenty-five R & D spenders worldwide.

South Korea saw two transformations in the twenty years from 1970 to 1990. First, the proportion of R & D done by firms and the state essentially reversed. Second, the share of R & D in GDP rose strongly. Absolute investment by firms in R & D rose dramatically: a rising share, of a rising share of a rapidly growing base means a double multiple. The industrial share of total R & D increased from 13 per cent of national R & D spending to 81 per cent, at a time when R & D increased from less than 0.4 per cent of GDP to 1.9 per cent, during which South Korea was growing at 8 per cent a year. The same has been true in China over the last twenty years: the industrial share of total R & D almost doubled during the trebling of the share of GDP spent on R & D, while China was growing at over 10 per cent a year.
  How has this transformation in industrial R & D happened? There is a double source. First, South Korea (as well as China) has seen substantial structural change in lead industrial sectors. Textiles and apparel, and food processing (low R & D-intensity sectors worldwide) have seen their share in industrial output fall. Automobiles, semiconductors, electronics and IT hardware (high R & D-intensity sectors worldwide) have seen their share rise. In India, automobiles are the only R & D-intensive sector to substantially increase their share of industrial output, a much more modest structural change.

Note: The 2010 numbers reported for China are from 2009.
Second, within industrial sectors, both South Korea and China have invested more in R & D semiconductors, especially in South Korea. This reflects a deepening of technical capability within sectors. This shows particularly in the growth of R & D spending at a few giant R & D spending firms, as Table 6 below shows. If we consider the top ten R & D spending firms in South Korea, China and India, the emergence of firms such as Samsung (at $15.3 billion, close to India’s total investment as a country in R & D) and Huawei (at $6.6 billion higher than India’s total industrial investment in R & D) illustrates the impact of a few large firms. It brings us back to our earlier point of R & D being highly concentrated; a few giant firms invest giant amounts in R & D. South Korea and China have seen their emergence as they have deepened their technical capability; India still needs to. Some of this gap is to India’s entire advantage: the single big cost in R & D is people. Costs in India are still between one-fourth and one-half that of an equivalent engineer or scientist in South Korea or China, presenting an opportunity I will return to later.

3.1. The Trade Regime
A separate chapter in this book covers our trade policy and export achievements; I provide only a few brief comments on the impact on technical capability. A critical component of the success of South Korea (and also Taiwan, Singapore, and China) in moving up the value chain and deepening investments in technical capability was their export orientation. Domestic protection was often combined with export promotion—indeed exports were often required as a condition for continued domestic protection. This had a dual benefit: first, export success forced firms to be competitive, and this had efficiency benefits for domestic production too. But there was also a direct impact on technical capability. Exporting provided for a substantial flow of technology from demanding buyers. Studies of how South Korea and Taiwan built their technical capacity identified technical flows from overseas buyers as the most important source of technology for firms, ahead of in-house R & D, technology licensing and domestic R & D institutes. This reflected the industries involved—textiles and garments, consumer goods, and OEM suppliers of appliances and electronics assembly. None of these required substantial investment in R & D. As the industrial structure changed towards automobiles, semiconductors and IT hardware, greater investment in in-house R & D supplemented, and eventually replaced, these flows of technology from buyers.
  Anecdotal comments from the two industries in India that are strongly export oriented—software services and pharmaceuticals—says technical flows from demanding buyers have played a similarly important role. But the absence of export orientation for most of Indian industry has deprived it of this flow of technology.
3.2. Imports and Exports of Technology and In-house R & D
Tables 7A and 7B show the growth of technology imports into India compared to other countries. Note that until the 1990s, import of technology into India was severely restricted. In recent years ($5 billion in 2014), payments for technology are comparable to total in-house investment in R & D ($6 billion in 2014). Exports of technology—in the form of contract research—have also been growing, if not as strongly. We often have a mental construct of technology import as bad, and exports as good. This is wrong. Growing technology imports together with growing in-house R & D reflects strong investment in technology by Indian firms. In the same way, I have long viewed the export of technology as benefiting the buyer more than the producer. In short, technology is not the product: firms and countries get rich by turning technology into products and services, not by selling technology.18 As Table 7B shows, the most successful periods of rapid industrialization across countries—Japan in the 1950s and 1960s, South Korea and Taiwan in the 1970s and 1980s, China since 1990—have been accompanied by significant imports of technology, considerably higher levels than in India until the noughties. Much innovation happens without recourse to formal R & D. R & D started to contribute significantly to Korean and Taiwanese industrialization only in the 1980s, and to China’s only in the 2010s. As we saw earlier, industrial development must precede the choice of investing in R & D.

3.3. Searching for an Explanation: Why Does Indian Industry Not Invest More in R & D?
The share of manufacturing in GDP: China’s manufacturing sector is today over ten times India’s ($3.7 trillion to India’s $330 billion). But Chinese firms today invest over twenty-five times what Indian firms do ($164 billion in R & D as opposed to Indian firms’ $6 billion). And the comparison extends beyond manufacturing.
The scale and profitability of firms: Are Indian firms just too small to invest in R & D? The general understanding from the field is that there is a threshold level beyond which scale economies do not apply to R & D, and Indian firms in many sectors are today well beyond that threshold. Our ten largest pharmaceutical, IT services, chemical and engineering firms all have a turnover of $500 million or more, which most would consider to be beyond this threshold level. Are Indian firms not profitable enough to invest in R & D? Even after five years of slow industrial growth, average corporate profitability in India (a return on sales of 10 per cent) compares well with China or South Korea.
  Table 3B showed that Indian firms invested somewhat less in R & D as a percentage of sales than their global counterparts. This is true in both our most R & D-intensive sectors of pharmaceuticals and auto, where our firms invest roughly half as much as a percentage of sales as the global leaders. But this is particularly true in the case of software. Compare the software industry in China and India (see Table 8). The top ten companies in China invest 8 per cent of turnover in R & D; in India, the top ten companies invest 1 per cent in R & D. An obvious explanation is that India’s software companies are software-service firms, not product firms. But most Indian software companies are worried about how long the existing model of labour arbitrage combined with excellence in project execution can continue to drive growth. No one would consider TCS, Infosys or Wipro to be either small or unprofitable. They just invest little in R & D.

4. From Half-formation to Transformation: What Should Our Priorities for Reform Be?
The purpose of an NIS is to build competitiveness in the long run. As wages rise, as natural resources are consumed, as the easier catch-up options are exhausted, it is the NIS that should enable an economy to keep growing over decades. This is particularly vital for India. It is entirely possible for an economy focused on labour-intensive manufacturing— textiles and apparel, footwear, food processing—to grow rapidly for years, as long as wages remain low; that is the source of comparative advantage. The East Asian NICs did so for years until rising wages forced a move to higher value-added sectors, and with it, forced investment in innovation. But as Table 5A shows, Indian manufacturing is not concentrated in these labour-intensive sectors: for various historical reasons going back to the 1950s, and unchanged even through the reforms of the 1990s, Indian manufacturing has not focused on labour-intensive manufacturing. Kochhar and her impressive roster of co-authors made just this point:
. . . it is striking that India’s share in skill-intensive manufacturing, which was already high in 1980 despite its lower level of per capita income, has been increasing and is at levels reached by Malaysia or Korea at much higher levels of per capita income. There is also a striking contrast with China. China’s share of output in skill-intensive industries is lower than India’s and has been virtually flat whereas India’s level has been higher and rising. The move towards skill-intensive goods is also reflected in India’s exports: the share of exports of skill-intensive goods has risen sharply from about 25 percent in 1970 to about 65 percent in 2004.19
In Section 3 above, I have argued that India must transform its NIS in the next twenty years, just as Korea did between 1970 and 1990, and China did over the last twenty years. It is instructive that near the beginning of this transformation, India already has a lower share of manufacturing coming from these labour-intensive sectors of textiles, apparel and food processing (19 per cent in 2010) than Korea (25 per cent in 1990) or China (22 per cent in 2010) near the end of theirs. In other words, for various reasons (hopefully explained elsewhere in this book20) we have for long had a manufacturing structure out of synchronization with our comparative advantage. We have a manufacturing structure focused on skill-intensive and capital-intensive sectors, sectors which require constant innovation, and constant and substantial investment in innovation, to be competitive over time. It is time our NIS matched our industrial structure.
  So what must we do?
4.1. Adding Dimensions to Structural Change: An Aside and a Point
A key driver of economic growth as countries catch up is the movement of people from lower value-added activities into higher value-added activities. Given our poor employment data,21 it is difficult to say specifically how many are employed where and how this is changing. Despite adding 10 million people annually to the workforce, there does not seem to be a drastic increase in those looking for work. In the absence of real data, simple observation says that we have been creating employment by the million quite successfully, though the bulk of the jobs created are in the service sector and support jobs. My favourite example is drivers in Delhi: Delhi accounts for a quarter of all cars sold in India, one-third of which are chauffeur-driven. That says Delhi has added over 1 million drivers in the last decade or so, but no employment data captures this. Regarding addition of jobs in the areas of hospitality, retail, delivery and construction, many Indian cities report reasonably tight labour markets: people are available for jobs, but they need to be attracted to better jobs from the ones they already have. So the problem is not jobs but good jobs. What is a good job? One which has higher productivity, and higher potential for improving value over time. This is why manufacturing matters. As Arvind Subramanian pointed out in a recent Economic Survey, ‘If the entire Indian economy were employed in registered manufacturing, India would be as rich as say South Korea.’22 Large-scale, labour-intensive manufacturing matters for precisely this reason.
  So, although an aside to an analysis of our NIS, fixing employment in India requires making labour-intensive manufacturing dramatically more attractive. A second aside is that given that most employment creation has been in services, we need to understand how to grow productivity in services over the long run. Productivity growth in manufacturing is well understood internationally, less so in services.
  Coming back to the NIS, we need to see a much stronger presence in those sectors that are the most technologically dynamic worldwide. Table 3A listed the top ten R & D-intensive sectors: pharmaceuticals, auto, technology hardware and equipment, software and services, electronic and electrical equipment, industrial engineering, chemicals, aerospace and defence, general industrials, and oil and gas. We have a small—or even non-existent—manufacturing base in sectors such as technology hardware, electronic equipment, and aerospace and defence. So our priority must be to establish a strong industrial presence in these sectors. The government’s initiative to attract investment by firms such as Foxconn and Flextronics, the world’s largest technology hardware manufacturers, is very welcome. Their growing presence will create a pull on component manufacturers to establish a local presence. As the component manufacturers in turn grow, the competitiveness of other (and smaller, higher value-adding) downstream assemblers will also be enhanced.23
4.2. Use the Availability of Skilled People to Build a Competitive Position Based on R & D
India has long had a distinct advantage over every other country in the availability of skilled technical people at relatively low cost. This is the source of our software industry and the growth in IT-enabled services. The IT industry has drawn on India’s massive production of 1.5 million engineers annually—compare that with the annual US production of 1,40,000 engineering (including computer science) and 1,60,000 natural science undergraduate degrees.24 At the height of the Indian software boom in 2000, when that single industry was recruiting over 1,00,000 engineers a year, it is striking that no Indian firm in any field had problems recruiting fresh engineers. They were still available in abundance, if not in quality.
  Indian industry has long had this luxury of an abundance of low–cost qualified people. But while engineers have been cheap, they have also been treated cheaply: recruited to perform jobs with undemanding technical content. It is only as economic reform has created a demand for product innovation and as engineer remuneration has risen sharply (in 2016, a good graduate engineer with five to ten years of experience would earn about five times in real terms what he or she earned in 1991) that firms expect their average engineer to do work with more demanding technical content. Few Indian firms, however, recognize the huge advantage they have in terms of low-cost qualified people, in reducing R & D cost and thus building competitive positions based on R & D. The pharmaceutical industry is a major exception: firms such as DRL, Sun Pharma and Cipla are betting on India’s lower R & D costs as a basis for competing long term in a research-intensive industry. So too are auto firms such as Tata Motors and Mahindra and Mahindra. But they are still exceptions. Multinational investment in R & D in India has been much more widespread. Eighty-three of the top 100 global R & D spenders are reported to have an R & D presence in India.25 For example, Astra Zeneca has one of their largest R & D labs outside Sweden in Bengaluru, and all their work on tropical diseases is now done there. Cummins has a design centre in Pune, which became its second largest (after the US) in three years. Emerson employs 4000 engineers at their R & D centre, also in Pune. Bosch employs 13,500 R & D engineers in India, their second-largest facility worldwide, and has announced a major expansion of their R & D presence in India. And most prominently, GE set up the Jack Welch Research Centre in Bengaluru in 2000, which has since become GE’s largest R & D facility worldwide. It employs 5300 people, two-thirds with master’s or PhD degrees, and today has the largest chemistry and chemical engineering PhD concentration in the country.
  Therefore, industry must recruit the best talent available and aim it at pushing forward product designs in their own industries.26 This talent should aim to learn from the best firms and research worldwide. As firms invest more in research, the demand for graduate engineers and PhDs will also grow. This will tie in nicely with the focus on graduate programmes and research in the IITs and progressively in other leading educational institutes.
  Our major software-service firms have a long record of success with rapid growth and high profitability sustained over decades. As we saw earlier, this success has not been accompanied by substantial investment in R & D. As the opportunity of further growth built around labour arbitrage27 decreases, the pressure to grow through innovation in both product and service will rise.
  All this will amount to an increased investment in R & D by Indian firms. The obvious powerful incentive that drives firms worldwide to invest in R & D is that they will otherwise be put out of business by competitors. When Tata Motors and DRL become more typical of their industries, as sectors such as software start investing a share of turnover in R & D comparable internationally, and as new R & D-intensive sectors such as technology and electronic equipment and defence grow, the investment in R & D by firms will meet the 1 per cent of GDP set as a national target.
4.3. An Invigorated Higher-Education System and an Invigorated Scientific-Research System: Two Sides of the Same Coin
The advantages of doing research in universities are manifold. First is the apprentice–journeyman benefit: the graduates that industry hires will come trained in doing research. Second, the industry–research linkage issue is immediately drastically reduced: every university has an automatic, costless and strong linkage with industry through students. Each time industry employs a graduate a new link is formed. Students know their professors and vice versa. Third, not just does teaching benefit from the research–teaching combination, research benefits too.
  Our end objective is clear: we should have a few really world-class research-teaching centres. The 2016 Budget announcement of developing ten public and ten private universities into world-class institutions is most welcome, but where will we get our highly qualified research faculty from? I would suggest we bifurcate CSIR and make it part ‘unexciting-but-useful Technology Assistance Institution’ and part ‘large pool of professors’. The 4000 CSIR scientists would be a huge impetus to the national higher-education system, particularly graduate education. The IITs are best off, but even they have faculty vacancies of over 20 per cent. Where are they all going to come from except through such an initiative?
  One of the strongest arguments against locating research in the Indian university system is that it might die there in the absence of a research culture. Building this research culture will be key, and will not be easy. Kenneth Arrow points to the example of Stanford University, which went through this same process in the 1950s, with huge success but with a great deal of pain. India would need to start with a few of the better educational institutes. The IITs, with their high teaching quality, outstanding student pool, abundance of alumni-funding opportunities, and lesser intrusion from the political system, are obvious starting places. But we would need to extend out to the university system in general, to build a few first-class institutes. Every college and university I have spoken to has said how much they want to do more research as a top, and in the IITs, the top, priority. But are they really willing to change their own recognition and promotion systems to reflect that every faculty member must do research? Conversations with a few academics at our best colleges and universities suggest that they increasingly are, but the process will need to be a highly focused effort spread over decades.
  A National Research Council could be set up to disburse the state funding now going to CSIR and all other state laboratories (including the defence laboratories), with all disbursements based on competitive grants, not budgetary support. The autonomous research labs must then become totally self-funding, which would drive their work in the technology-assistance direction. Some institutional reform could make it easier for industry to draw on CSIR facilities. Scientists could also compete for the national research funds with researchers from other institutes and from universities, and student participation could be an advantage in getting funded.
  Some research laboratories could themselves become colleges. Several of them already run PhD programmes and all should be required to do the same. But what is vital is that they extend their teaching role to postgraduate programmes, and form permanent linkages with undergraduate institutes. That would ensure the research–teaching combination advocated throughout this paper. The easiest reform would also be the most misleading: one could simply require every scientist to teach, no questions asked. That would probably involve the scientist teaching in the university system, while continuing to do his or her research in an autonomous laboratory. As Roger Noll points out, while basic research in many countries outside the US has grown, the fact that this research is often conducted in autonomous laboratories means that ‘it has not had a spillover benefit for higher education, even though many of the researchers in national labs are also university professors’.28 This reform could mislead us into thinking we have achieved the combining of research and teaching, and would miss most of the benefit of doing research in the higher-education system of training future researchers.
  All of these reforms add up to substantive changes. We need a serious debate on what should be done to dramatically increase the share of university research to international levels, which would be over five times what it is now (4 per cent to 20 per cent). Surely, a rejuvenated scientific-research system (a well-recognized problem in our autonomous laboratories is an ageing scientist core) is the other side of the same coin of a university system that does dramatically more research.
  The pain that will accompany these changes will be considerable, and not just for CSIR. Changing the basis of recognition and promotion within the university system will not come easily. The opportunity, though, is immense. The last few years have seen a huge interest in India’s human-resource capability. The IT services business, the R & D facilities that hundreds of MNCs run in India, and the interest that many leading firms show in sponsoring research at the national labs are all built around our abundant number of qualified people. Gaining from our low-cost R & D potential has spread from GE to DRL and Tata Motors; it needs to spread to Indian industry writ large. Building a few select research universities out of our better educational institutes would be a logical extension of an education system that already produces a huge number of engineers at the low end.
4.4. The Role of Policy
We have already covered the key policy role played by the state worldwide: to fund public research generously and broadly, and to do so in the higher-education system. We also discussed the value of focused effort to attract investment in those hardware-manufacturing areas that are largely missing in India. There are two more roles that the state can valuably play to build technical capability:29
To set the tone for discourse on technology: The great Indian cartoonist R.K. Laxman drew one of my favourite cartoons over thirty years ago. It shows a doctor examining a patient’s eye: ‘You have some foreign matter in your eye. Would you like to keep it since it is foreign?’ Seventy years after Independence, we still have a nodding acquaintance with our colonial past. Some public-sector firms specify in tenders that some products must be made in Europe or the US, regardless of local availability of better products. Several new shopping malls reserve prime ground floor space for foreign brands, pushing Indian brands to upper floors. The state can help Indian brands and Indian technology, not by the socialist rhetoric of the past or by subsidies or by reserving procurement to local suppliers, but by setting a tone of wanting the best and encouraging local brands and technology to be that best. (It can also shame those errant public-sector firms and private malls into change.) For many products, India is not a lead market; the product is developed for a different market and made available in India through import or local manufacture.30 Can the government launch a series of projects on particularly Indian problems: building flyovers in four weeks or addressing waste and sewage across a hundred cities at a time or providing clean drinking water to 6,00,000 villages? The government could fund R & D in both universities and private firms to develop solutions to these problems, in the process creating capabilities that could be used more broadly.
  Just in case the reader thinks I’m heading in a Swadeshi direction, let me set the balance right with my next point.
Trade Policy that embraces the world: For too many years, India’s trade-policy stance has been largely defensive—focused on limiting access of foreign firms to Indian markets. We need to adopt a more positive and outward-looking trade policy. How can we improve access for Indian firms to emerging markets in South East Asia, in Africa, in Latin America and the Middle East? Can we propose FTAs with the emerging markets where market needs are similar to India’s? And can we open our own market to foreign competition as the best way of forcing Indian firms to invest in technology? Twenty years after serious reforms began, we still impose high tariffs on automobiles, auto-components and a range of consumer products. The threat of being pushed out of business is an impetus to invest in technology like no other.
4.5. And Finally, to Firm Strategy and Entrepreneurship
In the mid-2000s, a new confidence seemed to be spreading across Indian industry. This showed in international acquisitions, which have ranged from disastrous (e.g. Tata Steel and Corus) to brilliant (e.g. Tata Motors and JLR). But it also showed in a few Indian firms choosing to become multinationals and combining this choice with strong investment in technology. No group illustrates this better than Tata, India’s largest group, with over half of its $100 billion in revenue coming from outside India and investing just under $3 billion in R & D worldwide. Tata is betting in business after business—energy, food and wellness, automobiles, digital consumer products—on building an international business resting on proprietary technology.
  The group appointed a chief technology officer in 2014, as a part of its increasing investment in R & D. In 2015, the group invested $3 billion of its $100 billion turnover in R & D. While investment has been growing, it is still uneven across the group companies. There are still some group companies that invest under 0.5 per cent of turnover in R & D. The group CTO, Gopichand Katragada, believes that one needs an investment above 1 per cent of turnover to start seeing outcomes, and that around 4 per cent is needed to build leading positions in sectors that are technology intensive.
  The group works to three time horizons. In the zero to three-year horizon, the innovation focus is within each company and aimed at technology differentiation. Board-level reviews take place of each company’s innovation and technology road map. An explicit assessment of innovation and technology has been included in the Business Excellence Model, with a CTO team trained in evaluation.
  In the three to five-year horizon, the group technology function brings multiple companies together, to work on technology and product development at the intersection of companies. Beyond five years, there is group-level collaboration with universities globally. A research centre focusing on graphene has been set up at IIT Madras, and initiatives at the Royal Society in the UK and at Harvard and Yale are under way.
  Tata is not alone. Mahindra, Sun Pharma, DRL, Cipla, Kirloskar, Forbes Marshall, United Phosphorus, SRF, Triveni and a hundred other firms have all been expanding investment in both international markets and R & D. The slowdown of the 2010s has dampened confidence, but it has not retrenched ambition. India needs a thousand multinationals, operating around the world, in every sector, building brands and reach. Our industrial structure, as we saw earlier, is already concentrated in skill and capital-intensive sectors. Building leading international positions in engineering or machinery requires substantial investment in innovation. A hundred Indian firms must match GE and Bosch and Emerson, each employing thousands of engineers in R & D. Our design institutes must produce world-class graduates that define new product functionality. Research-intensive higher-education institutes must provide a standard of graduate education second to none. And a combination of trade policy and firm strategy must push firms overseas, deploying their technical capability worldwide. As our firms grow into multinationals, a few could emerge as giant firms with the wherewithal to be leaders in R & D. The aggregate data will then finally reflect a transformed National Innovation System.

Consumer India’s Journey from Zero to Hero
Rama Bijapurkar
Indian consumers have been on a winning streak since 1991 and they have made the consumption explosion fully desi. The pace of change in Indian lifestyles, for the better, has been staggering and palpable even if one were to take stock every few years. By 2020 or 2030, India will be in the top five consumer markets of the world for almost everything.
It is not hard to imagine the consumption explosion that occurs when a very large group of people is liberated from shoddy goods and services, unaffordable prices, unaccountable suppliers and trying shopping environments. That is exactly the story of Consumer India since 1991 when the Indian government decided to decontrol the Indian economy and ‘open up’, allowing businesses to operate unshackled, in a free market. Consequently, Indian consumers started to experience quantum jumps in quality at lower prices and encounter products and services that they had never seen before; suppliers started to woo and seduce them instead of saying ‘take it or leave it’; and shopping environments designed to warm the heart and quicken the pulse started mushrooming. This was the magic of competition and the result of the government’s shift in strategy to get more tax revenue by lowering tax rates and betting on increasing economic activity. This wave of supply-side improvement has broadened, deepened and swelled steadily since 1991.
  In 1991, there was just one government-owned airline and one government-owned broadcaster. Today, 439 television channels are available at just Rs 7200 a year—under $10 a month—and 73 direct flights operate every day from Mumbai to Delhi, enabling you to fly without too much planning, at as low as Rs 7000 for a distance of 1400 kilometres. Earlier only the rich could afford to fly. In 2016, there were 100 million domestic passengers.
  India’s first cellular service was launched in 1995 with the unbearably high tariff of Rs 16 per minute and additional payment for incoming calls, which made it totally inaccessible to most Indians. Today, there are over 1 billion cell phone subscribers and typically, local calls cost Re 0.80 per minute—(amongst the lowest in the world)—and long-distance calls Re 1.15 per minute. All incoming calls are free and text messages cost less than Re 0.50 apiece. The price of the smartphone has come cascading down over the years and, today, for Rs 5000, you can buy a smartphone with a multitude of features.
  This supply-side renaissance has been matched by steady income growths buttressed by the increasingly easy availability and quantum of consumer loans. India’s per capita gross domestic product (GDP, adjusted for purchasing-power parity by the International Monetary Fund) grew five times between 1991and 2015 and retail credit almost ten times.
  It must be pointed here that India in 1991 was not a virgin consumer market (like China was when it opened up its economy): it was a partially decontrolled economy and already had a vibrant branding and marketing environment in a fair number of product categories. Consumers were exposed enough to it to have their appetite whetted, and were thirsting for more. Unleashing the animal spirits of marketers in such a fabulously fertile environment caused the consumption of everything to explode (in turn, fuelling economic growth) and the explosion has been resoundingly large.
An Uninterrupted Ride
Indian consumers have been on a winning streak since 1991. Unlike, say, the United States where median incomes have not grown for well over a decade, Indian households have seen a steady increase in their income and quality of living. Stock-market bubbles and housing bubbles have not come and wiped out pensions and life-savings of people, partly because many Indians do not have their savings invested directly or indirectly in the stock market, and partly because only a quarter of Indian households have formal debt. The steady pace of growth in incomes has meant that children often start off their working lives earning more than their parents did at the end of theirs. As a result, the pace of improvement in Indian lifestyles has been staggering and palpable even if one were to take stock every few years. All this has resulted in very high consumer confidence which, even when dented on occasion, has quickly bounced back with extraordinary resilience.
  Of course, there have been good years and bad ones since 1991. Consumer India’s road to increased consumption has hit many speed bumps, but, given the diverse nature of Consumer India, not everybody gets affected at the same time. When the American economy sneezes, the 8 to 10 million people and their dependents who work in the IT sector catch a cold and bonuses stop coming in and their spending freezes. Every eight years or so, 12 to 14 million government employees get wage revisions with retrospective effect and the sizeable bonanzas earned boost consumption even if other sectors of the economy are down. There have been some years when rural consumers suffered from continuously bad monsoons and others when urban consumers suffered on account of runaway food inflation. The after-effects of the North Atlantic Financial Crisis of 2008 was felt by those, mostly urban, consumers who worked in the globally integrated parts of India’s economy, and it was a bolt from the blue that interrupted the glory years of 2003 to 2008 when household income grew in double digits each year. However, in less than two years after 2008, the stock market and auto sales bounced back, and interestingly, the crisis of 2008 did not affect the rural consumers too much. In fact, they thrived and their incomes and consumption levels grew because of the serendipitous confluence of five years of steadily increasing minimum support prices for their crops, a one-time mega boost in road connectivity, a write-off in February 2008 of Rs 60,000 crore of outstanding bank loans by the government1 and five successive years of good monsoons.
  The period from 2013 to 2015, saw the reverse. Urban consumers were happy and urban consumption was on the upswing but it was a dismal period for rural consumers because of poor monsoons (43 per cent of rural income is agriculture based and 75 per cent of rural households have some degree of dependence on agriculture) and a slowdown in construction activity which affected a large number of rural consumers who worked as construction labour, because of an over-leveraged real-estate sector that was having a severe hangover.
Chinese Invasion and e-Commerce Revolution
But even through the bad years, there has always been upward mobility in income and quality of living, even if not always in line with consumers’ desires or past experiences, and the supply side kept getting better. While the consumption lift-off from 1991 till mid-2000 was driven by the move from bad supply to good supply and the accompanying income growth, two more booster rockets fired after that lifted consumption even higher. The first was the flood of low-priced Chinese goods and their steadily improved quality, especially after 2008, when the excess capacity in China found an outlet in India. China has contributed greatly to Indian consumers’ well-being, as we can see from the unimaginably low prices and improved quality of Chinese goods flooding Indian markets over the years. The ‘made in China’ label has moved up in consumer perception from being one of ‘cheap and shoddy’ goods, translating into bad value for money, to one where the quality is ‘good enough’ and the prices affordable. No wonder then that everything from Ganesh idols, Diwali decorations, plastic mats, earrings to apparel are now made in China and made for India. In the lower-income groups, children are now far better dressed; women have more saris and colour-coordinated salwar suits apiece; rough woollen winter clothes have been replaced with smart nylon windcheaters; there are fancy plastic jars in the kitchen and fancy hair grips and school bags for children. Indian consumers are buying Chinese-made little thumb-sized plastic fans attached to the cell phone to cool you as you read your SMSs and squeaky shoes with blinking lights to ward off snakes as you walk home through the fields.
  The second booster rocket that lifted middle- and upper-income household consumption was the rise of digital access and the advent of e-commerce. Born at the right time, e-commerce took off, fuelled by the confluence of steadily decreasing smartphone prices (largely on account of Chinese manufacturing), telecom companies advertising heavily to promote data usage at very low rates, modern physical retail bleeding from high rentals and not investing in customer excitement, and crumbling physical infrastructure and traffic in most big cities which made shopping an unpleasant experience. It offered an unimaginable variety of popularly used products at very low prices with exceptional service, all fuelled by venture capital. While physical retail remained staid and predictable, e-retail offered the excitement of discovery of a pan-Indian supply canvas—a plethora of boutique apparel and accessories and home-care brands, handicrafts, black rice from the Northeast, electrically operated grinding stones from south India, rare Ayurvedic and herbal medicines and more. E-commerce offered cash on delivery to those who didn’t trust online transactions and easy returns, no questions asked (a boon to fashion and apparel buyers). A popular online furniture store even ran a television campaign that had a lady looking at a massive chest of drawers, which had been hauled up many floors, and saying she wasn’t sure if she really liked it, after all. The customer-service person at the other end of the phone line replied cheerfully and empathetically, ‘No problem, we will take it back!’
  E-commerce and the sharing economy are just what the doctor ordered for companies to be profitable in a demand structure like that of India where a lot of people consume a little bit, each adding up to a lot, scattered over a large geographic area. Most companies have put a digital heart into their business that allows them to do this. And it is also just what the doctor ordered for Indian consumers who want to take an occasional bite of things they cannot afford to consume regularly. The sachets and so-called ‘paisa packs’ that drove the penetration of soap, shampoo, tea, cosmetic, etc. and enabled ‘regularly occasional’ consumption now have their conceptual extension in Uber and other ‘rent a party dress’ type of services. A whole host of new services has come into play which allow for dynamic pricing (think cheap airline tickets and hotel rooms), greater convenience in purchase (a registered mobile number is all you need to have, the rest is done by them), new services like the one where you go on a train journey and pre-order what you want to eat at any given station along the way, to be delivered to you or to your entire wedding party, hot and fresh, and so on.
Counter-intuitive Consumer Behaviour
Indian consumers rapidly became more adventurous and demanding. Religiosity has always been very high among Indians and a new god was added to their pantheon—the god of consumption. The story of India’s consumption journey can be told blandly and forcefully merely with numbers and analogies—how a small percentage increase in the penetration of refrigerators can add an Australia-population equivalent of refrigerators to India, how the steady growth in two-wheeler penetration makes India the largest two-wheeler market in the world, how by 2020 or 2030, India will be among the top five consumer markets in the world for almost everything. Indeed, it has often been told that way. But it also needs to be told through the counter-intuitive story of how Consumer India evolved. At every step of its evolution, it defied the assumptions of global consultants and multinational companies (MNCs), who believed that Indian consumers would modernize as India globalized and would soon be indistinguishable in their consumption behaviour and choices from their counterparts in the more developed world. Proof of the global consultants’ belief that all consumer markets would evolve in exactly the same way, based on the single factor of per capita income, can be found in the plethora of reports that came out in the decades of the 1990s and early 2000s—graphs that mapped countries with per capita income or per capita GDP on one axis and per capita consumption of product categories on the other. The size of the potential market was thus calculated and it was believed that the gap between the current consumption and this theoretical potential consumption would inevitably be filled in a matter of time. Evidence that MNCs thought the same way were found in the frequency with which CEO heads rolled, the incurring of prolonged financial losses in trying to ‘educate’ the consumer while despairing about how ‘difficult’ and ‘un-evolved’ the Indian consumer was, and discussions on when they would be ‘ready’ to qualify as global consumers.
  Indian consumers surprised Kellogg’s by not giving up their traditional breakfasts and embracing the nutritious, healthy, convenient breakfast cereal. They said that their idli and their paratha were as nutritious and that the ‘cost per stomachful’ for a family of four was better. They surprised cola companies by not consuming anywhere near as much as the calculation, based on equivalence charts of per capita income. They guzzled bottled water instead and made cola companies market the same. They did not abandon their nearby ‘mom and pop’ shop (less pejoratively called the kirana) and race to the nearest supermarket with its air-conditioning and neatly labelled aisles with modern tellers and transparent pricing. They treated the supermarkets as one more place in their repertoire of shops. The young did not make a beeline for famous American brands of jeans and sports shoes as consumers in other markets had. They patronized the knock-offs available on the pavements and did not see value in the premium that global brands demanded. They did not wolf down enough McDonald’s burgers and pizzas and KFC chicken. Instead, they forced them to change their menus. And while they didn’t consume what they ‘should’ have, based on their levels of per capita income, they consumed more than anyone ever thought they would of cell phones, talk time, value-added services and everything digital. They disappointed and confused Western multinational suppliers. But it wasn’t nationalism that drove their behaviour. They fed themselves on a staple diet of Chinese goods even while decrying their quality initially (a lovely cartoon floating in cyberspace says it all—it shows a woman crying at a failed suicide attempt because the ceiling fan that she was planning to hang herself from gave way and tumbled to the floor, and the wooden stool she was standing on cracked even before she could put the noose around her neck. The caption said ‘Made in China’). Consumer India patronized the Koreans in a big way, making Samsung and LG market leaders in home appliances and cell phones, and giving Hyundai cars a big boost.
  Indian consumers proved to be capricious and wilful when product trends were analysed—the patterns shifted constantly as in a kaleidoscope with every shake of time. Sometimes the lower priced-lower quality product segments were growing, and just six months later, the trend would be reversed. Sometimes it was consumer durables that commanded a large share of the increase in incomes and sometimes the raise got spent on travel and holidays. The average age of the homeowner fell drastically and as loans needed to get repaid, other categories took a back seat. Entertainment and electronics pushed shampoos and toothpastes down the ladder of desire. And there is always a mother of all battles across product categories for the share of the wallet. A hoarding during Diwali underscored it—‘Buy electronics not sweets this Diwali, sweets make you fat,’ it said.
  But there was always a ‘value logic’ to their apparently whimsical behaviour.
The Key Characteristics of Consumer India
Demand Structure: The Indian consumer market still is, and will remain for a long time to come, a collectively large market made up of lots and lots of people (consumers) who earn and spend a little bit each, and are geographically scattered and diverse. This is seen as hellish business economics but perfect for the new sharing economy made possible by Internet and e-commerce.
Value Extractors: Indian consumers have proved to be better at jugaad innovation over these last two decades than the companies that serve them. (They invented the ‘missed call’; they figured out that dual SIM phones can provide the double benefit of one slot being used to avail of the best prepaid deals from whichever telco is offering it, while the other is the number that never changes and only receives free incoming calls. They learnt to cut the glucometer strip into three, to be used three times instead of once, as prescribed.) Consumer India has proved to be a shrewd extractor of value wherever it may lie. It must not be dismissed, as it often is, as ‘value conscious’—a euphemism for ‘cheap’ and ‘doesn’t appreciate benefits’.
  An interesting range of low price-average quality-good design options now available for the first time has made Indian consumers far more experimental and readier to buy on impulse, use till bored, throw away when finished, or give away so that they can buy more. We used to joke earlier that the only thing Indians voluntarily threw out were the British. Otherwise everything was for keeps—to be hung on to till they can no longer be used, refilled or refurbished. But that has changed today—almost. More expensive items like consumer durables, cell phones and small electronics have a good trade-in mechanism. Dealers and Indian consumers realize that not throwing away the packaging in which cell phones come will enable them to get higher trade—in prices! The bulk of Indian consumers believe that their unorganized, pavement or hypermarket (fewer in number) shopping is more amazing and attractive than the large-format modern retail options. Young people always tell us that variety and frequent refreshing of their wardrobe are more important to them than big-brand labels and over-engineered quality clothing: street fashion in India makes sure that there is not much of a design gap between the two. The modest-income mass-market consumer used to rely on low-end brands from big companies for reassurance of quality and on brand knock-offs for status signalling; now the retailer provides the quality assurance and status signalling comes more from having the latest design than from the brand label.
Aspirational: The term ‘aspirational’ has been used so often to describe the Indian consumer that it merits some more discussion. Marketers just characterize it as normal human greed for a better life when people want everything they see others having openly or see advertised on television. But somehow this theory of envy-driven consumption doesn’t stack up against the facts. Inequality of possessions is not such a big heartburn that drives Indian society. Everyone accepts it as a fact of life.
  Aspiration is not an all-out desire for more and more. The Indian consumer has dreams and plans which are concrete in nature and steadily executes against them as and when they are financially able. Impulsiveness is not a part of their DNA except for small, affordable indulgences. The overwhelming popularity we have seen over the years of prepaid SIM cards, car and home loans with steady EMIs, systematic investment of small and steady monthly amounts (aptly called ‘sip’) in equity mutual funds are all testimony to this. This does not mean that he or she lives a thoroughly pre-planned life financially—far from it. Financial mis-optimism, that darker cousin of consumer confidence, is rampant. Ask them how long they can survive on just their savings, without any income, and the number turns out to be far more than it should be; however, prudence is the hallmark of the Indian consumer’s aspiration. Buying gold gives them the notion of gaining financial security and saving for the daughter’s marriage, though its returns are often unclear.
  What has driven such high aspiration? And what have been the things Indian consumers have aspired for? Anthropologist Arjun Appadurai has written extensively on a cultural process that he calls the ‘social imaginary’, explaining that imagination was not an individual escape into a private world but a collective activity—no longer mere fantasy (opium for the masses whose real work is somewhere else), no longer simple escape (from a world defined principally by more concrete purposes and structures), no longer elite pastime (thus not relevant to the lives of ordinary people), no longer mere contemplation—it is a form of negotiation between individuals and ‘globally defined . . . possibility’.2 Imagination uses informational resources to build the story of a better life. The Indian consumer has seen an explosion of information of all kinds, notably through television, with its ever-increasing range of programmes in all languages and watched several hours a day given the absence of other avenues of entertainment and a sea of new products available on the streets, in shops and through advertising. Rich or poor, they have used this information to imagine a better future, with products and services as a very important part of the story. As prices of almost everything have tumbled (cell phones, talk time, clothes, air travel), many aspirations have got realized too, paving the way for more. The increased variety and improved quality of supply at different price points and benefit levels, as compared to earlier times, has also helped balance consumer budgets better and make their consumption dreams come true faster.
Totally Digital: Nowhere else in the world have so many modest-income people been touched by so much technology, and embraced it so readily. The Indian consumers’ digital quotient (DQ) is remarkably high, and will only increase as the millennials come of age. They also blast the paradigm that is implicit in many people’s heads—that high technology is for the rich and the low for the poor. In fact, interestingly, many poor Indians will be served with digital products only as they enter the financial-services space, because physical services are too expensive and the ticket size of their transactions too low for the conventional physical methods of serving them. India’s welfare state may soon become entirely digital to fight corruption. Well before Aadhaar became ubiquitous, the Indian Railways made their ticketing totally online through a network of bricks (authorized agents) and clicks, making it the world’s largest e-commerce entity in terms of the number of customers served. Indian consumers have far fewer problems with technology than we would imagine—in fact, they embrace it. Wouldn’t you, if you didn’t have to stand in a queue at the crack of dawn in a railway station, not sure till later if tickets were available, worried about black marketeers muscling in and hoarding tickets? Now, with a PNR number given to you by your agent or by the computer, you can send an SMS and check the status of a waitlisted ticket; you know that everyone gets an equal shot at travelling, especially during the holiday season’s rush when demand for seats is far greater than their supply.
  Modest-income consumers also say that they prefer transacting on the phone or email or with a ATM machine because they don’t get discriminated against because of what they wear or the quantity they buy or the language they speak (or don’t, as in the case of English).
  The entire airline ticketing and travel process is a good way to see how much the consumer and consumption environment has evolved. It’s e-ticketing all the way. Now, at last, security staff at the airport gates are ready to look at your phone screen and not demand a physical printout before letting you in.
  Prices of phones and telecom have trended downwards and the ‘sachetization’ of data buying has happened too. So Indian consumers can pay per song or for a week of WhatsApp during a wedding, when group conversations are at a peak. Prepaid cards, the dominant mode of consumption, make for discipline in expenditure too.
  The digital Indian is here and ready to do more and more the e-way. Several government services have gone phone+Internet. In order to manage the costs of serving a scattered market with lots of people buying a little bit each, companies too have actively made their customer interface digital.
  And for those who hoped that a digital society would forge a more homogeneous, more modern outlook reflected in new consumer preferences and lifestyles, Indian consumers have proved just the opposite. Technology has made it easier to form communities, enabled parochialism across vast geographies, and Indian consumers can now shop for exactly what they want anywhere they are. There is more and easier access to all forms of religious practice. Translations of ancient prayers are now on the Internet; astrology has not vanished—in fact, its practice has been made easier by computerized horoscope-casting. Temples have gone online and offer e-services. If someone still needs proof, here is the story of a young person who was heard asking in a chat room, ‘If I cut and paste this mantra 108 times, will I get the same punya as when I recite it 108 times as prescribed?’
I Want It All My Way: Indian consumers never think in terms of this OR that—they think always in terms of this AND that. Yes, I want my pizza and burger but can you make the toppings tandoori chicken and the patty potato instead of beef? Yes, I like noodles but wholewheat with masala flavour, please. The repertoire of mix-and-match cuisine in any home, rich or middle-income, is larger and more diverse than ever before. Indian consumers don’t suffer from the confusion of contradictions—they e-shop but also enter a supermarket and want to ask someone, ‘Where do I find this colour, can you check inside if you have it?’ They shop on Amazon and they get to buy packaged cow dung (six varieties) for religious ceremonies. They have guided the creation of a whole new category of women’s apparel called Indo-Western and kurtis—short tunics that can be worn modestly with trousers.
Pragmatism Trumps Indulgence: Indian consumers are actually quite boring. Barring a tiny sliver, they prefer pragmatic, ‘do good’ consumption over impulsive, ‘feel good’ consumption.
  I was once asked by an American luxury-brand owner when upper-income Indian women would recognize the value of brands and be ready to spend $5000 on a handbag. My answer was that she already recognizes the value of brands and is using her money to send her kids to Harvard, after which she may consider the handbag.
  Seven out of ten homes in India have a young child and the aspiration that unites all Indians is to provide their children with the escape velocity to move into a higher orbit of living. Also high up on the aspiration list is owning a home with amenities that make for easier living. The lower-income Indian consumer wants to own a weatherproof house; the little better-off consumer wants electricity and water connections of his own. Durables that are productivity tools and help save time and boost income are high priority. The two-wheeler and the cell phone are the most wanted productivity-tools as is the refrigerator and LPG (enabling women to be more productive and work longer hours outside the home). Spending on entertainment and eating out ( seen as entertainment too) are also high priority for Indian consumers, who see them as a reward for the hard daily slog—stuck as they are between the pressures of a demanding modern economy and a creaking infrastructure, the logistics of living are very tough. However, it has to be entertainment which is affordable and not wasteful. Frequency of consumption of entertainment trumps quality and splurging. As Indian households have increased their incomes, they have opted to spend on pragmatic quality-of-life improvers (to make up for the pathetic state of public goods) for themselves and their children, on productivity tools that help them earn more and spend less, and on affordable entertainment and indulgences.
  Data presented by the National Sample Survey show that the fastest growing categories of expenditure between 1993 and 2015 were education, conveyance, consumer durables and healthcare.3
  Indian consumers have interesting and sophisticated value-processing logic and consume intelligently to optimize cost and benefit. The overlap between two-wheelers and cars is very high and car-owning households have cheaper brands of two-wheelers. One is the status symbol for the family and the other the workhorse. However, in families that cannot afford a car and only have a two-wheeler, the top-of-the-line brand is bought. Lower-income consumers will tell you that they subscribe to two pay movie channels because that keeps teenage boys at home—otherwise, they will go out and end up spending money—and also mothers-in-law so that they can cook dinner while the daughters-in-law work late and earn overtime wages. Consumers will tell you that a second-hand refrigerator signals status better than an expensive shampoo in the bathroom; and that going to the nearby hole-in-the-wall beauty parlour and getting hair blow-dried and styled is more gratifying than buying expensive haircare products for use at home. But modest-income consumers will also tell you that faced with the choice of using a cheaper material to plug a hole in the heart and a more expensive one, they will opt for the latter—the doctor’s fees, cost of surgery and attendant expenditure must not go to waste with even the slightest chance of failure.
Worth a Lot, Grossly Under-penetrated and Far More Demanding than its Worth!
Despite the significant growth in per capita income between 1991 and today, in absolute terms the bulk of Indians are far poorer than their counterparts in most of the world. Even by the broad-range definition of the ‘global middle class’ ($10–100 per day per capita), only 5 per cent of Indians qualify today for the category and by 2020-21, it will still be only 10 per cent that qualify.
  The oft-cited fact that the growth in sales of many luxury goods in India is significantly higher than their growth in sales in the rest of the world is not surprising, because even a small percentage of a large number is a large number. When a luxury auto brand says India will be their second- or third-largest market in 2020–21, it is not a statement of how wealthy Consumer India is; rather, it is a statement of how thinly populated the rich world is and how even the tip of the iceberg, the small percentage of India that is equivalently rich, is many times larger. It stands to reason that low prices will be the way to unlock the enormous collective buying power that Consumer India has. In recent times, we have seen several examples of this—shampoo sachets, cell phones, organized retail for second-hand two-wheelers, telecom services, and so on—and many more examples have been discussed earlier in this chapter.
  The problem though is that Consumer India is a demanding monster, made even more so by the exceptionally personalized service and low-cost offerings from low-overhead small suppliers who don’t invest in scaling.
  In the past twenty-five years, Consumer India has seen the prices of almost everything fall and the quality of almost everything go up. People are now used to this and their expectations have been shaped accordingly. As traditional marketers started facing margin pressures and talked of raising prices, along came the e-commerce wave and hyper-funded start-ups, and deep-pocket global companies locked in battle over one of the most valuable and difficult markets in the world. The sharing economy is in full force here, giving further boost to consumers who expect—and get—the moon for six pence
  Welcome to a consumer base that is overwhelmingly young, very, very large, hugely aspiring and consumption-loving, growing its income at a faster clip relative to the rest of the world, and one that has evolved over these past twenty-five years into one of the most attractive and one of the most challenging markets to serve.

Building a Global-scale Corporate in India
Mukesh D. Ambani
The born dreamer and natural doer that he was, my father dreamt of building a global-scale Indian business empire. And in economic reforms, he saw the opportunity to turn his dreams into reality. By seizing the opportunities created, Reliance Industries Limited has now emerged as a world-class and world-scale Indian business enterprise.
Introduction: Indian Economy through the Ages
The narrative about a new, emerging India creating and nurturing businesses having a global scale and reach is not new. It is, in fact, the reassertion of a forgotten tale in the history of this country and of its intrepid entrepreneurs. In precolonial times, India had been the envy of the world as a self-reliant and prosperous economy. Even until 1700 AD, India had commanded a dominant share of the global economy. Its merchants and traders serviced commerce across the seas, and its textiles and handicrafts set the standards for ingenuity and craftsmanship. Before the eighteenth century, India and China were the two largest economies in the world.
  Colonialism undid this vibrant economy. As noted by Angus Maddison, the British economist, India’s share of the world’s income fell from 24 per cent in 1700 (compared to Europe’s share of 25 per cent ) to a lowly 3 per cent by 1950.1 During colonial rule, India was by design relegated to becoming a mere supplier of raw material on the one hand and a consumer of finished products of British industries on the other. The biggest blow came in the form of massive imports of cheap textiles from England, breaking the back of some of the world’s most skilled craftsmen and traders.
  Post-Independence, India adopted a mixed economy. The 1980s heralded the first tentative steps towards some form of economic liberalization. However, the reform process got a serious push only in 1991, in the face of the severe balance-of-payments crisis that the country found itself in. India’s foreign-exchange reserves had dipped to perilously low levels—just enough to pay for seven weeks of imports.2 The country had been pushed close to the edge of default. The situation was so precarious that gold had to be pledged abroad.
  The government then signalled a systemic shift towards a more open economy. The policy discourse shifted to a greater reliance upon market forces; a larger role for the private sector, attracting foreign investment; reforms related to public-sector enterprises; financial-sector reforms; and a restructuring of the role of the government itself.
  My father, Dhirubhai H. Ambani, was among the few vocal supporters of the dismantling of the old policy regime. He was at the forefront of this campaign for change. Few people today remember that the first public discourse on a wide range of reform issues was inspired by him. It was he who suggested to the Observer Research Foundation to hold a seminar on economic reforms and seek the views of opinion leaders in the country. In a two-day seminar at the India International Centre in Delhi in July 1991, the inevitability of reform was welcomed by everyone. Several key figures of the time as well as numerous professors, teachers and students from as far off as Kolkata and Ahmadabad attended and contributed to this seminar. A set of papers was presented for discussion and the conclusions of the seminar were printed. My father patiently listened to every recorded discussion for hours and sought the opinion of a wide cross section of people on the issues raised in the seminar—so passionate was he not only about the process of reforms but also about what people at large thought about the measures being proposed.
  This was notwithstanding my father’s considerable early successes in doing business in the pre-1990s era. His strength was his conviction that in the long run, India’s—as also Reliance’s—growth would stagnate without the efficiency, innovation and quality improvement fostered by competition in the market. The born dreamer and natural doer that he was, he dreamt of building a global-scale Indian business empire. And in economic reforms he saw the opportunity to turn his dreams into reality.
  There was another reason why my father supported economic reforms. He never viewed government policies from a narrow industry perspective. Rather, his reference point was what benefited India as a whole. It was his unshakeable belief that consideration of short-term gains must never be allowed to triumph over long-term opportunities for both the nation and the company. A continent-sized country like India, with the second-largest pool of human resources in the world, needed to confidently compete globally—and win. His own life experiences had made him a believer in liberalization and globalization long before the validity of these ideas and concepts became the recognized drivers of policy action in India.
  In the ensuing years, successive governments unveiled major reform measures. The exchange rate moved from a fixed level to a market-determined rate. Customs duty reduced from a peak of 200 per cent to 50 per cent—falling even lower in subsequent years.3 India opened up its companies to foreign direct investment (FDI) and its stock markets to foreign institutional investors. Banking reforms and major capital market reforms were announced. Three important institutions for better governance of markets gave further impetus—the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), to serve as a statutory capital markets regulator; the National Stock Exchange (NSE), as a competitor to the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), the oldest stock exchange in Asia; the National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL), to facilitate electronic stocks for paperless authentication, trading and delivery. Together, they boosted the automation of capital markets, paving the way for transparent, screen-based trading, signalling that India was now ready to do business in a new way.
Economic Reforms and Changes to the Corporate Sector
The process of reform, once initiated, was bound to result in a major shake-up in the highest echelons of the Indian private corporate sector. It brought in changes that enabled new players in completely new industries to break into the top rung of the Indian corporate ladder. A wave of new entrepreneurship soon transformed the way of doing business, allowing many new and hitherto-unknown companies to come up rapidly.
  The data shows this churn. Of the country’s top twenty business houses today, only seven have retained that status since 1990, just over twenty-five years ago. A list of the top fifty companies today would, in fact, show that just fifteen of them had registered their presence on the charts in 1990. By way of contrast, the absence of churn before this period becomes self-evident if we examine the forty-year period predating the 1991 reforms, that is, from 1950 to 1990. We find eleven names holding sway among the top twenty through all of the forty years.4
  In the pre-reforms era, the country’s economic strategy had focused on a large public sector for which the planners reserved the commanding heights of the economy—the critical sectors related to infrastructure, energy and transport. The private sector was only allowed to function in a highly regulated space. Import substitution was the core thrust of policy. During the period, even as the Asian Tigers were roaring, the Indian economy lumbered along at a sluggish 3.3 per cent a year.5
  From a closed economy in the 1980s with limited access to international markets, India slowly but surely walked the path to becoming an economic superpower. Successive governments brought in structural reforms aimed at removing impediments to growth and fostering India’s global position.
  Today, India accounts for 3 per cent of the global gross domestic product (GDP, 1.7 times its share in 1980),6 2 per cent of global trade in 2016 (3.4 times of that in 1980)7 and has 18 per cent of the world’s working-age population.8 It is the fastest-growing major economy in the world with a growth rate of over 7 per cent, a thriving private sector and a supportive business environment. The private sector has not just laid the foundations of manufacturing and indigenous production in the country but has also become the driver of India’s infrastructure, employment and productivity growth.
  Access to newer markets, along with enhanced competition in these markets, implied that to survive and thrive in the new environment, companies needed to invest and innovate continuously on a large scale. This enhanced fixed capital formation in a capital-deficient country. As companies started investing in technology and acquiring market share, investment as percentage of the GDP climbed to nearly 30 per cent in the 2000s from about 20 per cent in the 1990s.9
  Today, Reliance is India’s largest exporter, contributing nearly 8 per cent of the country’s total exports. These changes owe everything to deregulation, which was critical in unleashing the country’s latent potential and enhancing prospects of growth.
Reforms Powered Reliance’s Growth into a Global-scale Conglomerate
This twenty-five-year period also saw Reliance Industries Limited emerge as a world-class and world-scale Indian business enterprise. Reliance ambitiously seized the opportunities created by the post-1991 reforms, expanding the competencies of our group. This happened because we realized the strong synergies between wealth generation for the nation and value creation for the company. In this, our motto, ‘Growth is Life’, captured the aspirations of both India and Reliance in a journey every stage of which was guided by Dhirubhai’s core conviction—‘What is good for India is good for Reliance’.
  We believe that it is India’s destiny to become a global economic superpower in the twenty-first century and regain its erstwhile glory and that Reliance must contribute to this transformation by becoming one of the world’s largest private-sector companies.
  Post-reforms, Reliance became one of the leaders in the private corporate investment cycle, envisioning and creating the world’s largest greenfield refinery. Our integrated complex at Jamnagar was conceived to house the country’s biggest refinery with a capacity of 27 million tonnes per annum (MTPA), along with a petrochemicals complex, a power plant, a desalination plant and a dedicated port—commissioned together with a total investment of Rs 25,000 crore in the ’90s.
  Dhirubhai conceptualized Jamnagar at a time when it was inconceivable for anyone in India to even dream of creating a business that could by its scale eclipse the big global players. No one in the private sector dared to have ambitions of making a one-time investment of Rs 25,000 crore. In creating this refinery we saw a whole new world of global market opportunity opening up before us. The ensuing years have seen the capacity of the Jamnagar refinery more than double to 66 MTPA. By making Jamnagar the world’s biggest and most complex refinery, Reliance, in effect, proved the immense possibilities latent in India.
  Without doubt, it was the liberalization of the Indian economy that enabled Reliance to mobilize the capital, labour and other resources from India as well as from across the world. Without liberalization, none of this would have been possible.
  In 1992, Reliance raised $150 million by venturing into the overseas capital markets with the first-ever international global depository receipt (GDR) offering by an Indian company. In 1993, the company pioneered the first-ever euro convertible bond issue by an Indian entity for a value of $140 million. A sum of Rs 2172 crore was raised from the domestic capital market for setting up the refinery at Jamnagar. In the following year, Reliance came up with the single-largest GDR issue aggregating $300 million. By 1995, Reliance was the first private sector Indian company to be rated by international credit rating agencies. It also became the first private sector company from India to raise $300 million in the international debt market in two landmark transactions. The year 1997 saw yet another first as Reliance became the first Asian company to issue fifty- and 100-year bonds in the US debt market, raising more than $600 million. These resources were used to expand the capacity at the Hazira petrochemicals complex. Following our lead and thanks to capital and financial-market reforms, it became progressively easier for similar Indian businesses to tap new sources of funding for greenfield projects as well as for expansion plans.
  The Jamnagar refinery required huge human-resource mobilization. Of all the people working on site, 10 per cent were expatriates from across the world. Half of all our workers were young, under thirty-five years of age. Reliance provided for the training and skilling of 3,20,000 people in carpentry, welding, electrical and instrumentation. Jamnagar, to my mind, became the first large-scale organized skill-development initiative of India. Once the refinery work was over, many would successfully migrate to the Middle East with their fully developed skills and become foreign exchange earners for India.
  Induction of the world’s leading oil and gas technologies was just one aspect of the design and planning for the complex. The parallel IT sector boom in India also played a crucial part in developing the Jamnagar refinery. Increasing globalization enabled us to establish several fully networked design and engineering hubs across London, Chicago, Houston, Mumbai, Delhi and Jamnagar. Connected via satellite, this IT infrastructure became a hub of perpetual activity. It provided round-the-clock voice, data and video connectivity to our engineers worldwide. It became the backbone connecting our design cell of 500 engineers worldwide for continuous, 24x7 residual engineering and field-construction support.
  Early on in its journey, Reliance recognized the importance of backward and forward integration of the value-creation chain and implemented it in the country. By the early 1980s, Reliance had executed its first mega manufacturing project at Patalganga, near Mumbai, in a record time of eighteen months. The purpose being the production of polyester filament yarn and polyester staple fibre—both raw material for the textile industry—that were being imported in the country until now.
  With Patalganga we began a journey that has remained to this day about investing in India and investing in businesses of the future. In the last five years alone, we have invested nearly Rs 2,50,000 crore in digital, petroleum refining and marketing, petrochemicals, retail and media businesses. Each of these projects stands as testimony to the company’s legendary project execution capabilities. Of this, we are investing over Rs 1,10,000 crore in our petrochemicals and refining businesses. We have invested more during the last five years than we did in the first thirty-five years of the company, making the current investment cycle the biggest in our history. The Rs 1,12,995-crore capex during FY 2015–16 is the highest by any Indian corporation in a single year.10 It is also about 0.8 per cent of India’s GDP and 2.5 per cent of the total investment. Our investments are spread across all our businesses and aim to create sustained and significant value not only for our stakeholders but also for the country at large. Ranked 215 in the Fortune 500 global list, Reliance, as the largest private-sector corporation in India, has now set its sights on growing even faster and stronger.
The Growth Trajectory of India and Prospects for Businesses of the Future
The trajectory of an economy as it develops has so far consisted of its transformation from being an agrarian economy through an industrialization-led manufacturing cycle to a services-led economy. Typically, this cycle has moved workers from low-productivity activities such as agriculture to high-productivity sectors like manufacturing and services by increasing specialization and economies of scale. We have seen this cycle repeat itself in nation after nation through the last century. The growth of Japan, Taiwan and finally China at the end of the millennium has followed the same trajectory.
  However, India has stepped forward as the first outlier along this well-known path of economic transformation. The first decade of the 21st century saw the Indian economy leapfrog from agriculture to services. Even as the share of manufacturing stagnated at 18–20 per cent of the GDP, the services field, led by a vibrant IT sector, saw the rapid expansion of communication, banking and business services.11
  Reforms led by deregulation, the liberalization of FDI and divestment of government-owned enterprises, particularly in telecommunications, have aided to the rapid growth of the services sector in India. India’s favourable demographic—a working-age population, which rose from 58 per cent in 1990 to over 65 per cent in 2015—has provided a large pool of talented young engineers and English-speaking graduates who have formed the bedrock of the IT revolution.12 In a networked world, the wage–cost advantage provided by this vast human resource has seen services exports grow by as much as 15 per cent per annum in the 1990s, from just 9 per cent through the 1980s.13
  Over the last three decades, these advantages have continued to play a role in expanding economic growth. We have seen India move from the G77 cluster of developing countries in 1991 to the G20. In purchasing-power parity terms, India is now the third-largest economy after China and the United States. This economic growth has come with increased employment and higher productivity. It has provided sustained sources of livelihood which, by boosting purchasing power and consumption, have catalysed a virtuous cycle of growth. Following the global economic crisis of 2008, even as the developed economies saw either de-growth or stagnation followed by tepid growth, with even the Chinese economy showing signs of weariness, India has continued to grow at a steady 7 per cent per annum against the five-year global average of 3.4 per cent per annum.14
  Since the 1991 reforms, private consumption has grown at around 6 per cent annually—far higher than the under 4 per cent rate of the preceding twenty years. The percentage of population living in poverty has halved from 45 per cent in 1993–94 to 22 per cent in 2011–12. Household consumption expenditure as a percentage of GDP now stands at 58 per cent, which, already higher than the average 54 per cent characteristic of low- and middle-income countries, is closer to that seen in the member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)—61 per cent.15
  India’s burgeoning middle class is recognized globally as an emerging and expanding market. Robust economic growth and rising household incomes are expected to increase consumer spending to $3.6 trillion by 2020, expanding India’s share of global consumption to 5.8 per cent by 2020.16
  As incomes increase, the composition of spending alters considerably, with discretionary expenditure on items such as electronics and personal care growing rapidly. Seeing the signs, many companies, including ours, have invested in the retail space. Foreign companies await the relaxation of FDI norms in multi-brand retail. E-commerce is rapidly making its presence felt as Internet penetration grows.
  For decades, the neighbourhood kirana store—family-run stores selling essentials—typified India’s retail sector. In the 1980s, some retail stores set up by manufacturers began to make their appearance in the metros. The 1990s then saw the arrival of multi-brand retailers followed by supermarkets and hypermarkets.
  India’s retail industry, currently valued at $600 billion, is expected to nearly double to $1 trillion by 2020. Organized retail covers only 7.5 per cent and is expected to grow at 20 per cent annually to reach 10 per cent by 2018.17 The goods and services tax, once implemented, will simplify the supply chain and bring down the costs and unify India into a single and seamless market.
  The rise in India’s prosperity, the proverbial growth of the Indian middle class and the aspiration of its youth for the best of products and services anywhere in the world are surely transforming the Indian consumer sector. Reliance Retail is responding to this change by building a global-scale, next-generation business technologically supported end-to-end by a robust supply chain. Quick to adapt to Indian conditions, the company is using technology to share the benefits of its procurement and supply infrastructure with hundreds of thousands of small and medium businesses. In the process, it is also generating substantial direct and indirect employment opportunities.
  The process began in 2006 with the aim to create stakeholders among farmers, small shopkeepers and consumers by generating a virtuous cycle of prosperity through win-win partnerships. Reliance Retail is already India’s largest retailer, having over 13 million square feet of retail space across 500 cities, catering to the needs of 3.5 million customers every week and generating over Rs 20,000 crore in revenue. This exemplifies an annual growth of over 30 per cent in revenues for the last five years. Challenged by the growth of e-tailing, Reliance Retail has quickly moved to bridge the gap between retail and e-tail. It has forayed into e-commerce with Ajio and Reliance Fresh Direct, creating an omni-channel experience for the consumer.
Jio Mission: Global Digital Leadership and Empowerment of Aspirational India
Reliance could not have embarked upon this transformative journey but for the continuous broadening and deepening of economic reforms in India. Liberalization and globalization enabled us to adopt a growth trajectory that integrated both organic and disruptive growth opportunities. A growth and development story at the very heart of which lay Dhirubhai’s vision of the mutualism between India and Reliance.
  Today, as the economic landscape increasingly veers towards the digital, the same mutualism holds true. The transformation of a country is by no means limited to just the economic sphere. Sustainable development encapsulates the notion of a multifaceted growth incorporating progress in human development. And as the global community adopts the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), if there is one modern disruptive development that has the power to transform lives and livelihoods in this country, it is the country’s digital leadership.
  In the explosive growth of mobile telephony in the country, we have already seen the fruits of reform transform the lives of the common man and woman. Owning a mobile phone was a luxury in the 1990s that only the rich could afford. India has already seen a radical transformation of its telecom space over the last two decades. When the telecom revolution began, Reliance was at the forefront. Our digital initiative too was thus envisioned by Dhirubhai, whose goal was ‘to put the power of information and communications in the hands of common people at an affordable cost’. We entered the telecom space with the world’s lowest entry cost and the world’s lowest usage charges for any telecommunications service, once again demonstrating that when we align with India and its people, it makes good social, economic and business sense. Our highly competitive tariffs and innovative plans enabled a significant reduction in overall telecom service charges, ushering in a telecom revolution in the country. The process of reforms first turned an aspiration into a necessity and then this necessity into a reality by placing the ubiquitous handheld device in the palms of literally every Indian. Today, India, after China, has the largest number of mobile phone subscribers—over 1 billion connections for a population of over 1.2 billion.18
  Meanwhile, technology continues with its onward march. Now the world is at the beginning of a digital revolution. Everything that can go digital is going digital—at an exponential rate, faster than anyone can imagine. By 2012–13, India had already witnessed a significant increase in Internet use, adding 100 million Internet subscribers between December 2013 and March 2016. Strong government focus on digitally transforming the nation with its Digital India campaign coupled with increasing consumer awareness and demand, and combined with declining data tariffs are now all set to steer the country towards a digital revolution. As of March 2016, the total number of Internet subscribers stand at 343 million, with the majority using wireless Internet (322 million). And data usage per subscriber (GSM+CDMA) has almost tripled from 59.6 MB to 147 MB during the same period.
  However, despite the progress, India still ranks 156th in the world for mobile broadband Internet access, out of 195 countries, in 2016.19 It lags behind other developing economy peers in terms of Internet access. In spite of the sharp increase in Internet penetration in the last couple of years to 26 per cent in 2015, India is behind peers such as Brazil at 59 per cent and China at 50 per cent. Bridging this infrastructure gap is now going to be the key to make India leapfrog into the next big economic cycle of the future.
  The Indian government today has a vision for rapidly expanding the digital infrastructure to bring India on a par with the most digitally advanced nations of the world. This thrust is absolutely essential to make the country relevant and competitive in this new era of technological innovation, as also for raising productivity for greater economic growth and human development. The prerequisite for this is a countrywide digital infrastructure followed by ease of access to it for the last person in India’s villages. If this is not done, an ever-yawning digital divide will only widen the socio-economic divide between the digital have and have-nots. Digital India today is about using digital technologies to bridge the socio-economic divide by exponentially expanding the opportunities available to transform lives down to the last mile.
  Aided by a young population willing to adopt technology, and supportive government policies, we are convinced that our country is well positioned to leapfrog the digital wave. Reliance Jio sees itself as the catalyst of this transformation just as it was to the nation’s telecom revolution in the 2000s. When we put the power of data connectivity, computing, software and information together, performance changes drastically. As a company it is our belief that the next twenty years of human civilization will collectively achieve more than what has been achieved in the last 300 years. Reliance Jio, with its best in class digital infrastructure, is well poised to spearhead this digital transformation and move towards accomplishing the government’s vision of Digital India. Our initiative to provide ‘any-time, anywhere access to innovative and empowering digital content, applications and services’ seeks to propel the next wave of transformation, aided by technology. With the Jio offerings based on the widest coverage, substantially superior network quality, transformational data capacity and affordable services, the outreach is unparalleled. Reliance Jio seeks to address any obstacle in the path of India becoming a digital society: it is working simultaneously on three fronts to ensure availability, quality and affordability.
How Digitization Will Transform India
Digital progress is expected to remove impediments to growth. Research suggests that a 10-point increase in a country’s digital score leads to a 50–60 basis points increase in GDP per capita for an economy, depending on what stage of digitization it is in.20 Evidence of other countries also suggests a sharp improvement in labour productivity and growth when there’s digital progress. According to a World Bank study, Internet adoption resulted in labour-income gains to the tune of 13–19 per cent in Peru. Similarly, in South Africa, cellular phone coverage increased employment by 15 percentage points, led largely by increase in female employment.21
  The impact of a digital transformation is not just limited to economic growth but is much more inclusive. Digital apps on education, health, agriculture and climate change, among others, would transform lives through digital learning and innovation. According to research, a 10-point increase in the digitization score leads to an increase of approximately 0.13 points in the human development index score of a country.22
  Eventually an India powered by the digital revolution will transform governance itself. The transformation in bringing governance closer to the people is already visible in some measure as payments for the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGA) go online, as we see people seeking help from the police station to the Ministry of External Affairs in the matter of issue of passports or visas.
In Conclusion: A Services-driven, Technology-supported, Domestic-demand-oriented Growth Strategy
In conclusion, while I am happy and highly satisfied with what Reliance has achieved for India and for itself in the past twenty-five years because of the advent of economic reforms, I see an even greater scope for the future. India today is different from what it was twenty-five years ago. Still, we have a long journey ahead as a nation.
  As the pace of change accelerates, today’s young have far greater aspirations and hopes. They are impatient to move ahead. Correspondingly, India’s reform agenda has to match their ambitions; its implementation must become speedier and far more result-oriented. At Reliance, we are engaged in nurturing the next generation of leaders, empowering them with skills befitting the entrepreneurs of tomorrow. Personally, I see this as my biggest job—to hand over a strong company for the next generation of employees, consumers and citizens.
  As a company as well as a nation, we need to set our purpose, to follow what our ancestors called swadharma, the pathway to becoming what we are meant to be. Reliance’s journey from hydrocarbons to retail to the new digital life is merely the outer manifestations of this idea. I believe that once we know what our country needs and how we can provide it, everything else, from finance and people to markets and value, follows. And we are not going to be alone in this venture because I believe we need hundreds of Reliances to serve the India of tomorrow, each firmly grounded in its own strength, each delivering value and creating wealth, each competing and supporting the others.
  A quarter century ago, India embarked upon the path of economic reforms out of compulsion. A combination of internal crisis and external developments forced India to accept reforms. Now is an opportunity for us to embrace the next set of reforms consciously, out of free choice, after careful consideration of all the internal and external opportunities. Along with opportunities will come challenges. Yes, digital may be the next big thing, but it is also the next big disrupter. As leaders, we need to embrace this disruptive potential and use it to leave behind a stronger company, a stronger nation, as we move on.
  Experience has taught us that consensus-building may take time in democratic India. But it ultimately succeeds and sustains itself only because it has buy-in from the people, as they see reforms yield tangible benefits. Be it banking, insurance, telecom, civil aviation, highways or power—India has seen that gains have come from reforms and increasing competition. Multiplicity of players has always been our strength and we must do everything to encourage it.
  Through all this constant process of churn and change, if I am sure about one thing it is this: that the prosperity of India is a future destined. Nobody can stop us, but us. We need to make our choices for the next twenty-five years wisely. And once we have chosen our path, we must follow it with the might of our collective will and the faith of our collective destiny for the materialization of our collective aspirations.

Rise of the New Entrepreneurial Classes and the Emergence of a High-growth Economy
Sunil Bharti Mittal
We are clearly looking at a future where entrepreneurship is going to play a pivotal role in economic growth. No discussion on Indian entrepreneurship would be complete without a reference to the global aspirations of Indian businesses, which is essentially a phenomenon of the last ten years or so.
The impact of the economic liberalization of the 1990s is best understood when seen in the context of its influence on entrepreneurship, which had largely remained in chains in post-Independence India. The reforms had come as a breath of fresh air to businesses both old and new, but the impact was most visible in the case of a new breed of young aspirational entrepreneurs, who could perhaps have never taken the leap but for the historic change in process. Having started my entrepreneurial journey in 1976, I had lived through the ‘Licence Control Raj’ long enough to realize the enormity of the change ushered in by the reforms.
  But, first, a bit about the political–economic environment that shaped the new ideological narrative.
  The 1991 economic liberalization was truly an extraordinary leap of faith that not just swept aside the decades-old legacy of socialism and state control but scripted a new economic landscape carved around free market and globalization. The change was as much ordained by our fatigue with a rapidly decaying economic ideology as by the alarming balance-of-payments crisis that the country faced at the moment. India went to the extent of pledging its gold reserves in the international market and, in fact, almost sold its embassy in Japan to raise foreign exchange. Besides India’s own financial troubles, what perhaps accelerated the change was the disintegration of the Soviet Union, India’s long-standing ally, and the rapid strides being achieved in China under a liberalized regime. The twin developments were forcing a compelling global narrative.
  The ideological orientation of the political establishment in the country had already given the first signs of ‘breaking with the past’ through deregulation of industrial licensing in the mid-1980s under the Rajiv Gandhi government, though only in a limited way. Entrepreneurs like me took their early steps during this period and, in a way, prepared themselves for the big changes of the 1990s. Bharti started manufacturing telecom equipment during this period, which also shaped our aspiration to become a mobile service provider when the sector was opened up in 1992. Introduction of private participation in air-taxi services during this period proved to be a precursor to the full-fledged private airlines, which entered the Indian skies in the 1990s when the sector was finally liberalized.
  Political uncertainty during 1989–91, when two minority governments came and went in quick succession, didn’t allow the process to take shape any further.
  The real impact of liberalization on entrepreneurship can never be understood in its entirety without a reference to the restrictive regime of the Licence Raj of the post-Independence years. Till the 1980s, India lived by very complex import and export policies and a very difficult industrial-licensing regime. Few people could get industrial licences, which were required for all kinds of manufacturing. Licences were usually granted to people who found favour with the government for lack of a transparent system of giving them out. Established business houses remained the obvious choice for the limited number of licences selected to be doled out; cronyism prospered. Small entrepreneurs had to be simply ‘lucky’ or ‘extremely creative’ to find small openings in government policies to move ahead. Even those ‘creative bursts’ often proved inadequate as new entrepreneurs always remained at the mercy of the government policy dictated by ‘a select few’.
  Here is an example of what it meant to be at the mercy of ‘a select few’.
  The first significant trade that we did at Bharti was to import portable generators into the country. We had entered into an exclusive agreement with Suzuki Motor Company of Japan to import portable generators. From 1982 to 1984, these imports became highly successful, and we set up a large distribution network across the country. However, in 1984—in one swoop—the Government of India decided to put a ban on the import of generators. The reason was very simple and straightforward: two business houses managed to get licences to manufacture generators, and they went to the government asking for a ban on these imports. All our pleadings for a review fell on deaf ears. So, overnight, we were ‘out of business’!
  Such an environment demanded you, as an entrepreneur, to always be prepared in the hot seat, ready to take a plunge into something new and unknown as soon as the government hit you with an abrupt policy change.
  The 1991 reforms ushered in profound changes in the economy. The government under Narasimha Rao, with Dr Manmohan Singh as the finance minister, junked the concept of ‘licensing’, pruned the restrictive list of imports and brought down import duties significantly. Several sectors, including telecommunications, were liberalized to include the participation of the private sector.
  The early 1990s saw the emergence of a set of new companies led by first-generation entrepreneurs in these liberalized sectors. Notable among these were Jet Airways, one of the finest airlines in the country today, and Zee TV, a well-known media house with one of the widest range of media channels. Then you had companies that had pioneered the IT space, such as Infosys and Wipro, though I must add that, more than domestic deregulation, it was the emerging global opportunity that held the key to the exponential rise of IT companies.
  India’s economic liberalization has all along proved to be a political conundrum. Government after government fell by the wayside whenever they tried to force the pace of reforms. While Narasimha Rao lost the elections in 1996, Atal Bihari Vajpayee—who also pursued the reforms agenda quite aggressively—lost after a six-year term. In fact, in the first fifteen years of reforms, India had five different prime ministers. Interestingly, despite strong and strident political opposition led by the Left against liberalization, all these governments exhibited remarkable fortitude in continuing on the path of reforms. This constituted a clear proof of the underlying political consensus among the non-Left parties in the country, though every political party, irrespective of their ideological leanings, struck a populist tone to oppose the reforms while sitting on the Opposition benches.
  Luckily for us, political discontinuity never really threatened ideological continuity, though periodic elections and the aforementioned populist play from the Opposition benches did, at times, slow down the pace of reforms. The Opposition was particularly visible in the area of foreign direct investment. It perhaps had something to do with our colonial hangover!
  Looking back on the twenty-five years of liberalization, it’s quite apparent that such massively transformational economic changes were destined to be slow moving, often coming in bits and pieces. The inherent complexity of Indian democracy and federalism makes consensus-building a time-consuming process. The recent Goods and Services Tax (GST) legislation, one of the most crucial economic reforms, is closer to reality now after being first conceived of in 2006.
  Despite the opening up of different sectors, life was still quite challenging for new entrepreneurs as the environment remained non-conducive and challenging for them. My own tryst with mobile telephony was a case in point.
  In view of my earlier experience with manufacture and marketing of push-button telephones, I had an instinctive attraction towards mobile telephony when the sector was opened up to private players in 1992. But I was acutely aware of my handicaps. First, Bharti, though a well-known name by then through its Beetel-branded phones, was a small company—with an annual turnover of about Rs 25 crore—for such a big dream, as most of the big names of the Indian industry were lining up for this historic bidding process. The other problem was more technical in nature. Given the clear lack of expertise and experience among potential bidders, it was mandated that every bidder had to have a foreign partner with expertise; for a company of our size, it was difficult to find a big global player as a partner.
  After striking a partnership with Emtel, a small Mauritian company, I managed to convince the French mobile operator SFR after much persuasion (which incidentally even contemplated pulling out of the bid at the last moment, citing our small size as a big concern for a large company like themselves). Fortunately, good sense prevailed, and we not only managed to go through the bidding process unscathed but eventually won the Bombay Metro licence (‘Mumbai’ now), surprising everyone. A small player like Bharti winning a mobile licence obviously didn’t go down well with other bidders and led to some unwarranted litigation, which finally ended with Bharti being offered the Delhi-circle licence instead of the Bombay one. Finally, we managed to launch our service in Delhi in September 1995.
  Finding network equipment suppliers was another challenge we had to contend with. After signing with Ericsson for the supply of equipment, which was to cost us almost $27 million, I clearly remember telling their president, Kurt Hellstrom, ‘I can pay you only 15 per cent of this and the rest only when the networks are up and my customers are happy.’ This was an audacious statement to make before a reputed global equipment supplier. However, it was a statement coming from an aspiring entrepreneur short on capital but eager to reach out to his dreams. More often than not, what saved the day for the new class of entrepreneurs was that they were never short on spirit.
  The trials and tribulations of my small company did highlight one thing: notwithstanding the reforms at the highest level, the system at the operational level still suffered from decades-old inertia, which was ironically trying to undo the very things that the macro-level policy changes aimed to achieve. Twenty-five years later, I feel extremely happy that the sheer exuberance of the new class of entrepreneurs triumphed over this systemic inertia to make the ‘India Story’ possible.
  Liberalization was not going to be a ‘one-shot affair’ though, as it also involved the resolution of many sector-specific regulatory issues that kept popping up every now and then. Governments from time to time addressed these issues effectively to maintain the momentum. A great example of this was the way the newly elected NDA government in 1998 under Atal Bihari Vajpayee addressed the issue of high fixed licence fees for mobile telephony, which struggled with slow growth in the early years. It made a momentous decision to shift from the fixed licence fee regime to a revenue-share model under the New Telecom Policy (1999). This eased the operators’ financial burden considerably and helped them prepare for the next stage of growth; at the same time, it filled the government coffers with much higher fee as revenue share, given the explosive growth of the sector. Such policy calibration often became a necessity in the long-term interest of the industry and the country.
  Another big challenge for a nascent sector like mobile telephony was in getting the ‘right people’. There was an acute shortage of telecom talent (mobile technology, in particular) in the country when the industry was liberalized. Job aspirants often remained sceptical about the sector’s stability. The problem was particularly severe in the case of a small company like ours. We often had to fall back on people from other sectors to fill up positions in functions such as marketing and customer service. Often, I had to use my personal charm to impress upon ‘good talent’ to join us. The other problem we encountered, although only temporarily, was in terms of organizational stability, given the rapid rate of organizational growth in the mid-2000s, which we had to undertake to meet the exponential rise in demand. The organization did shake for a while under this rapid expansion load but settled down soon.
  Rapid growth also entailed increasing organizational complexity for us. We had to not only find new managerial talent to handle this complexity but also be careful not to allow bureaucratic tendencies to set in, which has invariably been the bane of large organizations. We did take particular care to maintain the ‘heart of a small company’ in the midst of increasing organizational complexity. Speed and agility in decision-making remained a priority for us. In fact, these twin virtues turned out to be the most critical enablers for the new class of entrepreneurs.
  Penchant for innovation and the ability to think ‘out of the box’ happened to be reliable allies of the new breed of entrepreneurs. The need to cater to India’s unique market condition required them to be creative with their products and processes. They had to create/adapt products suitable to Indian tastes and preferences and, more importantly, bring them within the reach of the Indian ‘buying power’ through appropriate innovation and engineering.
  Airtel’s outsourcing business model constituted an outstanding example of this. It was an unprecedented model, which envisaged outsourcing of key functions such as network management and IT services. Under the new model, we were not required to instal or maintain network equipment or IT infrastructure and, instead, had to focus on our core activities—marketing and customer care. We accordingly entered into Service Level Agreements (SLAs) with network-equipment suppliers such as Ericsson and Nokia, who had to set up the networks to provide us service and ensure a certain desired network uptime. Airtel was required to pay for capacities coming out of the network and not for the boxes. Often called the ‘dollar per Erlang model’, it ensured that Airtel no longer had to worry about how much infrastructure to add on as the suppliers had to plan and optimize the network to ensure adequate capacity and high quality. Many considered it a disastrous route to take, as letting the network be managed by an outside agency was like ‘giving your heart’ to be managed by someone else. We also entered into a long-term IT-outsourcing agreement with global giant IBM, under which every IT equipment (down to the desktop on an employee’s desk) was to be managed by them. The payment was linked to outcomes. Only a part of the payment was committed as ‘fixed’; most of it was linked to our revenues.
  The SLAs, in effect, not just resulted in a sharp drop in upfront capital expenditure but simplified the cost structure for the company. The model helped an operator expand its networks faster and simultaneously brought down overall costs significantly. The success of the new model silenced the critics and soon became the ‘new standard’ for operators across the world. This innovative business model went on to become a case study at the Harvard Business School.
  Another path-breaking innovation by the Indian telcos in the next few years was the ‘passive infrastructure sharing’, which meant that operators were ready to share their towers and related infrastructure with their competitors. It further eased up network expansion cost, facilitating a quick network rollout. Network and IT outsourcing and passive infrastructure sharing constituted the two basic pillars of Indian telecom’s low-cost business model, which later also facilitated rapid expansion of services in other emerging and developing markets.
  Coming back to the telecom growth story, by early 2005, Airtel had become the first private operator to have a pan-India footprint—a huge achievement in a country of our size, with twenty-three operational circles. Low call rates and affordable handset costs were gradually making mobile telephony a mass product, and the industry was suddenly experiencing a ‘hockey stick’ growth trajectory. The sudden change in the trajectory can be gauged from the fact that by 2003, Airtel had just 3 million customers on its networks; this has crossed 360 million today, including its customers in overseas markets. The explosive growth over the last decade or so clearly points to the very empowering nature of the technology and the extremely aspirational character of the Indian consumer, who turned out to be eager adopters of technology.
  No discussion on Indian entrepreneurship could be complete without a reference to the global aspirations of Indian businesses, which is essentially a phenomenon of the last ten years or so. It was very clear that Indian businesses were too small compared to their global counterparts when India opened its door to globalization in 1991. In fact, the critics of liberalization always predicted that Indian businesses would in no time be swept away by their foreign competitors once the different sectors are opened up to global competition. However, contrary to this pessimistic prognosis, Indian entrepreneurs were actually knocking on foreign doors in a matter of one and a half decade of liberalization for big M & A deals. From natural resources and commodities to telecom, IT, automobiles and pharmaceuticals, Indian companies have made their mark on the global stage by the sheer strength of their business models and appetite for growth.
  In telecom, Airtel has remained, till date, the only Indian company to have ventured into global waters in any significant way. With an innovative business model that helped us deliver one of the lowest tariffs in the world, we were fairly confident about replicating the business model in emerging markets. After putting our ability to test for overseas play in the South Asian neighbourhood—Sri Lanka and Bangladesh in 2009–10—Airtel finally made its big statement in Africa when it acquired Zain Telecom’s fifteen markets in the continent in June 2010. Valued at $10.7 billion, the deal remains the second-largest overseas acquisition by an Indian company till date. Today, as the third-largest mobile operator in the world (by customers), Bharti Airtel truly symbolizes the evolution of Indian telecom sector over the last two decades.
  Over the last twenty-five years, the economy has swung from a 3–4 per cent growth trajectory to more than 7–8 per cent. A large part of this growth is accounted for by the rapid growth of the service sector, led by sectors such as telecom, aviation, media, IT, ITES, retailing, healthcare and tourism. India too has emerged as a key global hub of research and development, largely on the strength of its huge pool of technical manpower. These sectors have emerged as a fertile ground for entrepreneurship. Today’s e-commerce and other Internet-based businesses led by entrepreneurs in their twenties and thirties are only an extension of this hugely transformational trend.
  From a conservative mindset that only encouraged young people to look at government jobs as preferred career options, Indian society has changed dramatically over these years. Entrepreneurship is considered a priority option today, as hundreds of bright engineering and management graduates from premier institutes are getting attracted to this exciting arena. Thanks to the rise of venture capitalists and private equity funds eager to place their bets on young Indian entrepreneurs, we are clearly looking at a future where entrepreneurship is going to play a pivotal role in economic growth. The cultural change is obvious when you look at the social background of some of the most successful technology- and Internet-based business entrepreneurs today.
  Liberalization has affected Indian society at multiple levels. Sustained economic growth and consumerism has often been perceived as the most prominent face of this process. But the underlying force driving these twin processes has undeniably been the entrepreneurs. They have continued to bloom in ever greater numbers every passing day to drive this powerful growth story forward. The story of Indian liberalization has truly been the story of Indian entrepreneurship.

Liberalization and a Tale of Two Companies: Open the Cage and Let the Birds Fly
R. Gopalakrishnan
The unshackling of the Indian economy led to dramatic changes within the Tata group, which rejuvenated existing businesses, developed new ones, aggressively expanded in overseas markets and launched breakthrough products, hiking its turnover by almost twenty times over the period. And HLL developed an enormous appetite for organic growth, something which industrial licensing had thwarted all these years, increasing its market cap by a factor of thirty in the process.
During a visit to China in early 2016, I learnt of the ravaging consequences on Chinese labour because of the ongoing industrial restructuring in the Guangdong province. Older factories were closing, workers were being laid off, and new factories were coming up. There was considerable disquiet among the working class. The policy of the Guangdong government was reported to be Thong Long Huan Niao, a Cantonese expression that means ‘Open the Cage and Let the Birds Fly’. As I understood it, the provincial government likened the uncompetitive companies to caged birds and encouraged them to fly out and design a new life for themselves and their workers.
  Allegorically, Indian industry was in a similar situation in 1991 when liberalization occurred. The bird cages were indeed opened with the tectonic changes to Industries Development and Regulation Act, the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act and the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, three key laws that held industry on a draconian leash. Industrial licensing, monopoly laws and foreign-exchange transactions were relaxed, diluted and modified over a period of time. This essay is the story principally of two companies, their dilemmas, their pathway out of the cage and their transformation—HLL (Hindustan Unilever Ltd, aka HUL, but called HLL in the essay) and Tata (as a group of companies).
Liberalization from My Perspective
Liberalization events are viewed differently by several players, depending on from where they observed and experienced developments. In January 1991, some months before liberalization, I went away to Jeddah as chairman, Unilever Arabia. Things were not going well in India at the time; for that matter, neither was Arabia inviting, what with clouds over Kuwait followed by the Gulf War. I was apprehensive about how events would unfold in both geographies.
  Within a few months, a number of dramatic developments took place in India, which I watched from Jeddah. At the end of 1994, I returned as managing director of Brooke Bond Lipton India Ltd and, thereafter, as vice chairman of Hindustan Lever. Through these roles, I personally experienced the maelstrom of liberalization. As part of the team with HLL Chairman Susim Datta and colleagues, I participated in a dramatic rearrangement of Unilever businesses in India. Some years later, I joined Tata Sons as director; as part of the team with Ratan Tata and colleagues, I participated in the rearrangement of the Tata group. Both of these have been hugely impactful experiences from my professional point of view.
  For this essay, the editor requested me to write an anecdotal essay to answer questions such as:
i. What transpired out there in the companies as liberalization occurred?
ii. What new degrees of freedom did companies get out of liberalization?
iii. What were some of their dilemmas and how did the companies resolve them?
I felt that a good way to write would be to narrate a few events through the lens of what I saw firsthand or what I could relate with closely. HLL and Tata are two storied business groups with over a century of existence; they responded to the demands of the time and renewed as the ‘children of liberalization’. HLL was very keen on expanding in the Indian market, while Tata was eager to expand both in domestic and international markets. HLL was, and remains, the most ‘Indian multinational’ company, and Tata the most ‘multinational Indian’ group.
  I will also—albeit briefly—touch upon the wave of start-ups; as an aside, I will ponder over a non-technology Indian company—Patanjali Ayurved Limited—that has rapidly built a somewhat controversial FMCG business, the size of which took Unilever a century to build. Patanjali would not have happened without liberalization.
The Early Years of Liberalization
HLL
In 1990, when Susim Datta became chairman of HLL, he inherited a fairly strong company, which had weathered numerous challenges of the infamous Licence Permit Raj. The vexatious issue of 51 per cent foreign equity for Unilever under FERA had lasted through the 1970s and 1980s, and was finally resolved through the strenuous efforts of T. Thomas and Ashok Ganguly, two earlier chairmen. However, HLL, being a FERA company, was not allowed to increase production of detergents or source from third parties, as a result of which the company had not been able to respond effectively to the market threat posed by Nirma, a small-scale manufacturer of detergents.
  In the early 1980s, HLL had grabbed an invitation from the Punjab government to buy into the equity of a sick, government-owned detergent company, Stepan Chemicals. Being outside the ambit of FERA, Stepan Chemicals was permitted to outsource products from third parties. What a circuitous route to take to get production capacity! To conform to FERA, HLL had entered into the chemicals and exports businesses, both of which were reasonably stable. But if there were to be some degree of liberalization, these just-stabilized businesses would face fresh challenges.
  The winds of change had been blowing through government and administrative corridors ever since, but they could not develop into a strong gale because of several political developments. As recounted later by Susim Datta, when he reflected on the contemporary national developments, it was obvious to him that dramatic change was around the corner. The trouble was that nobody knew exactly what the change, and how affecting, it would be. For many decades, multinational company leaders had been advocating liberal free market and consumer-driven markets as the panacea for Indian development. Their advocacy flowered into reality quite suddenly in May 1991 when Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao (industry portfolio), Dr Manmohan Singh (finance portfolio) and P. Chidambaram (commerce portfolio) embarked on liberalizing industry and trade. HLL was psychologically prepared for change but, not knowing the contours of these changes, was only ready on a surface level.
  Early during liberalization, the company decided to seek external advice and engaged Professor Sumantra Ghoshal of London Business School to work with the leadership team. (In the Licence Raj, foreign exchange for such consultancy was difficult to get approved.) Liberalization appeared to bring with it new uncertainties, so HLL developed alternative scenarios along with an aggressive vision: to double sales every four years and double profits-after-tax every three years. This was akin to a pilot deciding to break the sound barrier with no experience of the resultant sonic boom: the pace of the company would have to increase to a level that nobody had experienced before. Such thinking became possible entirely due to liberalization.
  Now, HLL could expand production capacity and set up new capacities without the painful process of applying to the government for industrial licences. Even before 1991, HLL had built a couple of new factories, thanks to a government policy for industrially backward areas of the country. However, it could not refresh or resize its existing factories. Within the first decade and a half of liberalization, none of the six factories (in Bombay, Garden Reach, Shamnagar, Ghaziabad, Trichy and Etah) that produced products when I joined the company remained recognizable. Most were sold or closed down due to labour issues, product obsolescence or uncompetitive cost structures. Brand new and modern factories with new work practices were put up. Such a renewal of manufacturing could just not have been contemplated, let alone executed, during the licence-permit days. Susim Datta later recounted: ‘I would like to believe that although the initial problems were very large, in the end this dispersal of the manufacturing facilities has helped the company—certainly it did during the years I was there. It was against this backdrop that HLL settled into a period of growth, an era of mergers and acquisitions, and a period when there was a lot of media attention on us.’
  Another aspect that HLL had to completely reorient was consumer research. The company already had strong skills in market research, but realized that those would not be adequate to meet the needs of the future. Due to global exposure through media, the consumer would change rapidly, their expectations would escalate sharply, and competition would aggressively track these developments. The expenditure on consumer research was upped progressively and new techniques, such as simulated test markets, sequential recycling and qualitative research, were implemented.
  HLL developed an enormous appetite for organic growth, something that industrial licensing had thwarted all these years. This aspect of the company did not fetch newspaper headlines but some of the biggest successes were achieved through organic growth. The company’s large detergents division led the charge by developing the vision, foresight and courage to accelerate organic growth in order to improve its market presence by adopting a target of making and marketing ‘1 million tonnes by 1994’. Before liberalization, HLL’s detergent division was selling about 4,50,000 tonnes and this new ambition and the drive to get the growth to reach a million tonnes by 1994 was perceived as big, audacious and gutsy. HLL achieved this growth by organic means by building completely new factories and by backing chosen brands that included the Wheel detergent bar.
Tata
Just a kilometre away from the HLL office, a newly appointed corporate leader sat in his fourth-floor office at the eponymous Bombay House. On 23 March 1991, patriarch J.R.D. Tata had his ‘usual’ Monday morning meeting with his acolyte, Ratan Tata. However, the patriarch said something unusual at this usual meeting: ‘I have decided to retire as chairman and to appoint you in my place as chairman of Tata Sons . . . I have not decided the date because I have to consult Ajit Kerkar.’1 Ajit Kerkar, the chairman of Indian Hotels, was very good at picking auspicious dates, and JRD clearly wanted the day to be an auspicious one. A wonderful example of tradition woven with modernity!
  After the initial period of what Ratan Tata subsequently termed, ‘basking in the glory of the change’, he settled down to the task of thinking about what his agenda should be. In reality, Ratan Tata had started thinking about transforming the group’s operations a decade earlier when the redoubtable J.R.D. Tata had appointed him as the chairman of Tata Industries. In that capacity, Ratan Tata had scripted a ‘Corporate Plan’, a sort of blueprint for the group, with some assumptions about the economy and government policy. The plan had to wait several years for the mantle of leadership to fall on his shoulders, and so also, coincidentally, the magic of liberalization.
  Like many other companies, Tata companies, in particular the flagship Tata Steel and Tata Motors, had suffered for decades during the Licence Raj era, with its unjustifiable controls over production and pricing, mindless quotas for allocation of resources and severe restrictions on imports. Foreign-exchange controls meant that companies had to struggle to convince officials while importing new machinery or deploying state-of-the-art technology; even business leaders and top executives found it difficult to travel abroad on business trips as there was a ceiling on the amount of foreign exchange that could be spent on a per diem basis.
  A company like Tata Motors, for instance, had a licence to manufacture just 50,000 commercial vehicles per year in the mid-1970s. The average cost of a truck was Rs 100,000 per vehicle, and the profit margin was a mere Rs 4000 on each vehicle. There was an underdeveloped vendor base and the company had to produce everything that went into a truck. In that era of scarcity, it was virtually impossible to import anything; yet, certain critical things had to be bought abroad—for instance, pens (and ink) to make blueprints. It cost a whopping Rs 3500 to import a single drawing pen, equivalent to the profit from a whole truck!
  The odds were loaded heavily against the Tata group. It was a relatively small Indian business entity in a world dominated by giants with deep pockets; it lacked scale and operated mainly in just one market—India—when its international rivals had the advantage of operations across the globe. It was involved in a bewildering assortment of industries, and lacked focus, thanks to the restrictive laws. Most of its revenues and profits were derived from commodity businesses; its own few brands were weak compared with global brands.
  Bound by an older, slower style of functioning, the Tata group had considerable work ahead to face the fast-paced competition of the future. It was concerned about quality, but given the lack of customer orientation, a mark of the protected Indian industry in general, it had to do a lot more to match market-savvy rivals. And quality had yet to pervade all aspects of operations and strategizing.
  Ratan Tata started a series of dinner meetings with his acquaintances at McKinsey. Through these discussions, he came to the conclusion that the group should be restructured to become more competitive, to provide better returns to the shareholders, to be more nimble-footed or more proactive to the changing scene, than it had been in the past. These meetings led to the articulation of a set of papers for discussion with the Tata Sons board. The plan was to critically look at the many Tata companies through a group mechanism that did not exist until that point of time. It should be mentioned that the MRTP regulations also imposed burdens on the group concept.
  It was thus that the GEO (Group Executive Office) was born, which I joined from my perch as vice chairman of HLL. The intention was that the GEO would consist of a group of executive directors of Tata Sons, who would have the responsibility of overseeing the performance of various operating companies. The GEO would also look critically at restructuring the group by way of mergers, acquisitions of our core businesses, as also divestments of companies that were in businesses which were not considered core or where the Tata market position was not predominant. Several of these ideas and concepts could be considered because of liberalization in the business environment.
  Ratan Tata’s first hard decision was on the Tata Oil Mills Company (TOMCO), which had built a detergents-and-soaps business for the group since 1923. The Tata group was identifying the core sectors to concentrate on and grow. TOMCO had been losing money for some years and it appeared as though the business would not fit into the Tata view of its future. Soaps and detergents were, on the other hand, core to HLL. It was, therefore, an opportune moment for the two companies to ink a mutually beneficial agreement. The Tata decision to exit TOMCO and the HLL appetite to acquire it for growth went through the appropriate processes. TOMCO was acquired and merged into HLL.
  The TOMCO sale was a dramatic development, unimaginable just a few years back in the India of old. Not surprisingly, it emerged as the most newsworthy and sizeable acquisition of the time. There were difficulties galore—the regulatory formalities, getting the proposals passed through the respective boards, resolving the legal aspects of the merger, etc.. It was a crucial turn in the HLL growth story, and just as crucial a step in the Tata divestment approach. Ratan Tata faced so much criticism from within the group that, as he confessed later, he became hesitant to undertake further divestments. TOMCO’s managers received the HLL integration team with considerable suspicion, though the two learnt to work collaboratively to consummate the deal. The HLL integration team was delighted when Ratan Tata expressed his appreciation of how the team handled the acquisition.
Talent and Capital
To appreciate the constraints under which companies had operated prior to liberalization, I also mention two additional points on management talent and access to capital. After all, people and capital are key factors of production.
  The remuneration paid to directors of companies used to be controlled by the Companies Act. Even if a company was making reasonable profits, the managerial remuneration was restricted by Company Law. Throughout the Licence Permit Raj, there had been significant brain drain of talent from India because top professionals sought pastures in overseas markets for better remuneration. After liberalization, the pernicious ceiling on remuneration was significantly relaxed. Profit-making companies could pay their top talent using principles of meritocracy, market rates and affordability. The scenario changed the talent market dramatically. Over a period of time, professional talent in India could earn and save pretty much what was possible in other countries. Thus, the managerial talent market also got liberalized by the events of 1991.
  HLL stepped up the globalization of its managers by seconding about 1000 managers abroad over the next quarter of a century. At any point of time, 100 HLL managers were on overseas secondment in jobs within Unilever. In this way, a large pool of managers with a global mindset was trained. Many continued within Unilever and HLL but, in due course, several found leadership roles in other companies in the Indian industry. Tata also placed human resource development on its transformation agenda when its work with McKinsey was ready for implementation. Tata Consultancy (TCS), for example, had to design and implement HR systems for the tens of thousands of knowledge workers it was recruiting each year. In the new century, TCS was recruiting 5000–6000 technically qualified engineers per month, and training them to deal with a global mindset, of customers who were largely overseas!
  With regard to equity capital, the office of the Controller of Capital Issues (CCI) got abolished. Companies could now test the market to price their fresh equity on a market-based approach. This required improved corporate governance. The appointment of a hugely talented civil servant, G.V. Ramkrishna, as chairman of SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) brought in new regulations, which allowed new degrees of responsible freedom to well-intentioned companies. Indian entrepreneurs grew very fast into the new growth areas such as software, telecom and infrastructure. Meaningful and successful IPOs such as Infosys, Tata Consultancy, Biocon and Bharti Telecom would have been impossible under the earlier regime of the CCI. The league table of the top 100 companies witnessed big churn in the rankings through the entry and exit of players.
The Later Years of Liberalization
HLL
Apart from pushing for organic growth and an early acquisition of TOMCO, HLL refocused its thrust on several vectors. Since this essay is about liberalization, only those initiatives are highlighted that could not be undertaken earlier due to restrictions. First was a major product-quality drive by benchmarking locally produced products with imports, pointing to the urgent need for upgradation. HLL internally proselytized techniques such as TPM, and considered imports of machines and packaging materials, as required. Second was the special emphasis on product innovation and the setting up of a second international R & D centre at Bangalore. Third was extended, multifarious business collaborations with the parent Unilever. Earlier, Unilever could not be remitted brand, technical or service fees, but such expenses could now be paid under the new dispensation.
  Being a global leader in ice creams, Unilever had for long been very keen on establishing an ice-cream business in India. Under the Licence Permit Raj, dairy ice cream was reserved for the small-scale manufacturer, being one out of some 750 items so reserved. On the grounds that vegetable fat-based product, which was called ‘frozen dessert’ by HLL, was different from dairy ice cream, Brooke Bond Lipton set up a brand-new investment at Nashik and launched Walls Frozen Desserts. This became very controversial at that time, though the controversy died a natural death with subsequent de-reservation of several reserved items, including ice cream.
  After acquiring TOMCO, there were many more high-profile M&A activities. HLL went on to acquire Lakmé from Tata after appropriate governance processes were done on both sides. HLL also divested its phosphate chemicals business to Tata Chemicals. The acquisition of the public-sector company Modern Bakeries from the government followed. Later, HLL divested its hair-oil brand Nihar and purchased an Ayurvedic hair-oil brand called Indulekha. Cadbury’s ice-cream operations were acquired by Brooke Bond Lipton. The company entered into a hugely complex deal to acquire four independent Kwality ice-cream entities, all of which used a common brand name. This would help Unilever to establish an ice-cream business in India. Kissan tomato products business was acquired from the flamboyant Vijay Mallya, as also the Zahura tomato plant from PepsiCo India. It was an appropriate vehicle for the ambitious plans that Brooke Bond’s foods business had for the branded products market.
  When I was managing director of Brooke Bond Lipton, I found a company whose employees had experienced as many as ten mergers within just the previous four years: first, Brooke Bond acquired Lipton, then Doom Dooma Assam and Tea Estates India, followed by Kissan, Milkfoods, Zahura and four differently owned Kwality entities. All this was possible in such a short time because of liberalization. As an aside, I might point out that the resultant company suffered from a considerable bout of indigestion. In a quandary about how to handle management morale, I casually asked an assistant hailing from Kerala what the future bore for the company. Being a trained astrologer, he promptly cast the company horoscope after ascertaining the date of birth from the company’s registration certificate, and pronounced, ‘This company has so far behaved as a man and has given the company’s name to several people he married. The company will get peace of mind by behaving like a woman and by taking the name of the husband she should marry.’ His astrological opinion did not at all influence the subsequent decision to merge Brooke Bond Lipton with Hindustan Lever! It became the biggest merger and was also highly controversial because it led to some legal cases.
  Before liberalization, India was quite insulated from global media, trends and thoughts. The winds of liberalization brought in global ideas into business, and in the case of HLL, this began in the mid-1980s, a tad ahead of liberalization. HLL strived to be productive not only in economic terms but also in terms of benefitting the environment. HLL started the first experiment with Chhindwara in Madhya Pradesh, where it began to recycle significant quantities of treated effluent back into process or on land for irrigation. This saved cost for the company but ensured that HLL’s operations would not strain the rural environment. The chemical engineers in the factories explored the possibility of designing zero-effluent factories long before it became a part of sustainability programmes. Reforestation attempts at Khamgaon in Maharashtra were started for similar reasons.
  In 1991, HLL earned a revenue of $700 million, which has grown to over $5 billion now. The company’s market capitalization has grown from $900 million to over $28 billion currently.
Tata
The Tata group seized the opportunities presented by the reforms and embarked on a remarkable journey that has, over the past quarter century, transformed it into a vibrant and global business house. Tata began executing a disciplined programme of transformation within a few years of liberalization. The group devised four ‘welding’ mechanisms:
* The setting up of the GEO;
* The setting up of a common, unified brand;
* An explicit code of conduct, which had been implicit all the earlier years; and
* A set of operating requirements for companies that used the brand.
With MRTP gone, Ratan Tata increased the group ownership in the major companies and re-established Tata Sons as the focal point of the group, an opposite action to what J.R.D. Tata had done earlier to comply with the MRTP legislation. Where increase of shareholding was not possible, as in the case of Associated Cement Company, Tata shareholding was sold to an international cement major. Some group companies such as Forbes Forbes Campbell and Co. Ltd and Tata Infomedia were divested from Tata. There were multiple companies in the same market space and, over time, attempts were made to rationalize them; for example, Tata Steel’s power plants were bought by Tata Power. The group company, Tata Infotech, and public-sector company, CMC, were both acquired by TCS at different points of time and later were merged with Tata Consultancy in separate public transactions.
  The serial mention of these moves does not mean that the decisions were easily accepted or implemented through a ‘command and control’ mechanism. Each one required a de novo debate with directors of different boards; each one was perceived at the time to be a ‘non-Tata way’ of solving a problem; and there followed a sequence of cajoling, determination and doggedness while implementing.
  Several Tata companies also had their heads buried in the sand. Many businesses looked inwards and measured themselves against their own past performance. The external impression was that Tata was less nimble than others, more resistant to change and extremely set in its ways. Unless Tata companies were benchmarked against the brightest and the best, the probability of change was going to be low. In the early years, Ratan Tata observed candidly, ‘We have yet to seek excellence in all that we do. We hang a picture slightly crooked and live with it for ten years; this should bother us the first time we see it, and keep on bothering us until it is set right.’
  The Tata group adopted the Tata Business Excellence Model (TBEM), based on the quality-improvement framework developed for the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Awards, first launched in the US as a means of responding to the quality challenge presented by Japan Inc. in the 1980s. In February 1995, the first batch of assessors met at the Tata Management Training Centre for in-depth training on the Baldrige model. They assessed twelve Tata companies, and the average score was an abysmal 215 out of a maximum score of 1000 (in 2016, the major Tata companies crossed 500, with several of them passing 600). The alarm bells rang loud and clear. The journey was to be long, painful and exhausting, but liberalization demanded that Tata undertake the journey, even for survival.
  The first winner of the JRD Quality Values Award for performance within the TBEM framework, Tata Steel in 2000, went on to win the Deming Prize in 2008, and then the coveted Grand Deming Prize in 2012. Indeed, TBEM set the tone and created the foundation for a critical transformational exercise in the group. It has also been the glue in binding the group together and enhancing the Tata brand. The opening up of the economy, the removal of unnecessary restrictions relating to investments and the relaxation in foreign-exchange rules emboldened the Tata group to break out of its traditional orbit and head for other geographies. This created capabilities within Tata companies to compete successfully in the Indian market, and thereafter grow in international markets with the confidence of being able to hold their own against their global peers.
  There were many group company events and anecdotes that related closely to liberalization, but four are particularly worth mentioning. The first is the dramatic restructuring undertaken by Tata Steel during the 1990s. Within a decade, Tata Steel had been transformed by downsizing the workforce to about half its starting size. The remarkable feature was that this tough decision was implemented with empathy and humaneness; the Tata action became symbolic of how to do disagreeable things in an agreeable way. The plants were modernized with new technologies and a management mindset was instilled, one which could dream of and execute big transformations.
  The second event is the entry of Tata Motors into the passenger-car business. During the earlier stewardship of J.R.D. Tata and Sumant Moolgaokar during the 1970s, truck-maker TELCO, as it was then known, was denied an industrial licence to manufacture passenger cars in a new joint venture with Honda. When Ratan Tata took over as chairman of Tata Motors, he proposed something daring: to design and launch an indigenous passenger car, ground up. Tata Indica was launched in 1999, and later, the Tata Nano. Irrespective of the market reception or performance of these products, even a critic or cynic would concede that both events were transformative not only for Tata, but for all of India Inc.
  The third is the difficult decision by Tata Sons to press ahead with a Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) IPO. By the mid-1990s, TCS cash flows had become material through the Y2K boom. TCS evolved the practice of retaining half its profit with the balance being used by Tata Sons. This was a huge benefit to Tata Sons as they were able to use the TCS export revenues to reduce the tax exposure on the dividend income. Further, an aggressive TCS, ranked beyond thirty among global IT players in 2000, set itself the hairy goal of breaking into the top ten globally, not just in terms of revenue but also profitability and other transparently stated metrics. The company had worked with Professor Pankaj Ghemawat but, in a sense, stumbled onto this audacious goal through its internal brainstorming. The company set about its task through a huge organizational transformation to help its people think globally about customers, work processes and quality. On 25 August 2004, as the success of the TCS IPO became clear, easily India’s largest and most complex IPO, there was jubilation within Tata and a new aspiration for Indian business houses in general.
  All of the above three events are positive stories for liberalization. The fourth event concerned airlines and was not a happy ending. As the parent of Air India before the iconic company was nationalized, Tata always harboured a deep desire to re-enter the airline business. When airline entry rules were liberalized in the 1990s, Tata spent considerable effort to execute a business plan through a JV with Singapore Airlines. After a great deal of advocacy and diligence, Tata’s efforts were frustrated and the company unhappily withdrew its application. It was a painful reminder that crony capitalism was still alive and kicking in a rapidly liberalizing India!
  Had MRTP continued, Tata could not have implemented its TBEM or the Code of Conduct. The adherence of Tata companies to both the TBEM process and the Tata Code of Conduct was permanently enshrined in the Brand Equity and Business Promotion Agreement. Each Tata company subscribed to this agreement in order to secure the right to use the Tata brand. This played an immense role in presenting to the world Tata products and services that stand for performance and trust. Alongside key initiatives in governance, brand promotion and business excellence, the Tata group quickly developed an understanding of the critical importance of innovation in order to successfully compete in the global economy.
  This eventually led to the formation of the Tata Group Innovation Forum in 2007, and the celebration of the group’s pioneering instincts through the annual Tata Innovista Awards. The group’s recent disclosure of having crossed a milestone of 7000 patent applications, a number that has doubled in just the last two years, reflects the rapid progress that the group is making.
  Beginning with Tata Tea’s acquisition of Tetley in 2000, the group made several significant overseas acquisitions, including Corus by Tata Steel, Jaguar and Land Rover by Tata Motors, and Brunner Mond by Tata Chemicals; all in the UK—Daewoo Commercial Vehicles by Tata Motors in South Korea; NatSteel in Singapore and Millennium Steel in Thailand by Tata Steel; General Chemical Industrial Products by Tata Chemicals; Eight O’Clock Coffee by Tata Tea; Tyco Global Network by Tata Communications in the US.
  The unshackling of the Indian economy led to dramatic changes within the group, though its core ethos and emphasis on ethical business practices and its commitment to the communities in which it operates have not changed. The journey since the reforms process began has been exciting for the Tata group, which has rejuvenated existing businesses, entered new ones, aggressively expanded in the overseas markets, and launched breakthrough products.
  Twenty-five years ago, the Tata group had a turnover of just $6 billion. In 2014–15, group revenues topped $108 billion. Back then, Tata had little by way of overseas operations; today, it operates in more than 100 countries across the globe. In 2014–15, the group had international revenues of $73 billion, accounting for 67 per cent of total revenues. The twenty-nine publicly listed Tata enterprises had a combined market capitalization of $116 billion as of 31 March 2016. The companies in the Tata group are now building Brand India all across the globe. The lofty and refreshed vision for the Tata group is that by 2025, 25 per cent of the world’s population should experience the Tata commitment to improving the quality of life of customers and communities.
Start-ups
I should mention very briefly another phenomenon, which too is a derivative of liberalization in India. There arrived a bunch of new messiahs, born and nurtured in the post-liberalization atmosphere. These were IT-driven start-up businesses, helped along by the development of a supporting ecosystem. These ventures were based on disintermediating traditional business models and became possible because institutions such as venture funding and entrepreneurship-mentoring also entered the business space.
  It is noteworthy that a non-technology-based start-up called Patanjali also took birth and is reported to have grown rapidly. In 1993, a twenty-five-year-old youth named Ram Krishna Yadav established a flourishing yoga practice and soon became famous as Baba Ramdev. Nobody could have imagined that this rustic youth would build a commercially competitive FMCG entity within ten years to the same size that HLL took a century to do. He owns three or four yoga and spirituality television channels, which is reported to have developed a viewership about 200 million! Prior to liberalization, a private party could not have owned a television channel!
  His story gains some importance in the context of this essay because even as century-old companies such as HLL and Tata were adapting to modernity and open markets, Baba Ramdev began a process of modernizing a 3000-year-old tradition of yoga. Charak, Zandu, Dabur, Vicco Vajradanti, Kesh King, Chandrika, Himalaya and many more had been around for decades. The newest wellness brand, Patanjali, attracted consumer interest and franchise to a far stronger degree than any of the predecessor brands. The views and reasons for its apparently instantaneous success range from good brand stewardship, supply chain/marketing savvy and intuitive play on a latent consumer longing for the ‘natural’ on the one extreme to a less complimentary view that it is a form of politically inspired crony capitalism. It all depends on who you speak to! The fact is that such an operation could not have happened without liberalization. Prior to liberalization, every new entrepreneur would have had to get his unit classified as a ‘small-scale unit’ or, if it’s a large industrial undertaking, obtain an industrial licence to set up his unit. The access to foreign exchange for import of process or packing machines was painful. The entrepreneur would have to spend considerable time ‘cultivating’ the numerous inspectors and authorities to keep his unit functioning. No dramatic market impact could be planned until many years of painstaking effort had been expended. None of these are necessary any longer.
  Start-ups promise to be the new poster boys of growth; though the outlook is ambiguous and is constantly debated, start-ups, digital or otherwise, are also the children of liberalization.
Before Liberalization and after Liberalization
We can consider the fitness and business performance of Indian companies in the BL and AL eras, standing for ‘before liberalization’ and ‘after liberalization’. Evolution teaches us that the longest-surviving species are not the biggest, the fastest or the strongest, but the most adaptive ones. HLL–AL is still India’s top FMCG company, but the company is very different from the HLL–BL, so too with Tata. Yet, both companies have many more tasks ahead.
  I have access to five data points from the last seventy-five years when the top business groups were published by public authorities. In 1939, the Indian Business and Nationalist Politics published that TATA was India’s number one group; it was so again in 1951 (R.K. Hazari Report on the Corporate Private Sector), and it continued to be so in 1969 (Licensing Policy Enquiry Committee), 1990 (Gita Piramal, Big Business and Entrepreneurship) and in 2016 (Capitaline Database).
  To become number one is not easy. To stay number one for seventy-five years is incredibly tough. This is a small measure of corporate adaptiveness, especially when during the same period the half-life of Fortune 500 companies had rapidly declined.
  The years of protection and consequent lack of competitiveness of Indian industry in 1991 is emotively captured by a Paulo Coelho blog from 10 November 2010, ‘The Bird and the Cage’. A woman loved a bird so much that she caged the bird. In captivity, the bird gradually withered away and died. The woman felt miserable and she herself started to wither. One day, she had a visitation from Death. ‘Why have you come?’ she asked Death. ‘So that you can fly once more with the bird across the sky,’ Death replied. At the risk of dramatizing the situation, Indian companies were the caged bird and the Indian economy was the woman. Thankfully, India averted such a conversation with Death.

25 Years of Reforms that Led India’s Pharmaceutical and Biotech Industry towards Global Leadership
Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw
The last twenty-five years have been transformational for Biocon: our global competitive edge is being built on a strategy of leveraging India’s lower-cost base to deliver high-value but affordable products and services. We aim to be an innovator from the developing world, addressing unmet medical needs through research and manufacturing excellence that will build global leadership in time.
Introduction
The colonial ‘hangover’ of being an over-regulated economy started receding twenty-five years ago for India. This brought our nation back from the brink of defaulting on international payments in 1991 to make it the emerging global economic hotspot that it is today.
  This economic transformation is the outcome of systemic and wide-ranging economic reforms that were introduced in 1991 and implemented gradually with sustained political will. It is often a crisis that forces reforms. That is exactly what happened twenty-five years ago when India successfully converted serious fiscal challenges into economic opportunities by bringing in a slew of progressive measures. Economic reforms led to the decontrol of private investment, opening up of the economy to foreign trade and foreign investment, and changes in industrial policy, patent protection rules and price controls. The banking sector and capital markets also witnessed sweeping reforms. Taken together, these reforms released the pent-up economic energy of the country, triggering an acceleration in gross domestic product (GDP) growth, which almost touched double digits during 2005–07.
  This growth trajectory was further bolstered by the meteoric rise of India’s software services and, to some extent, the pharmaceutical sector. These trends had a visible impact on the proverbial brain drain, which seemed to reverse. Whilst software engineers built India up to make it ‘the back office of the world’, scientists enabled the Indian pharmaceutical industry to earn the label of being the ‘pharmacy of the world’ by catering to the global demand for safe, effective and affordable generic drugs. This was in stark contrast to the situation at the time of Independence in 1947, when India’s pharmaceutical market was dominated by Western multinational companies (MNCs) that controlled 80–90 per cent of the market, primarily through imports. Approximately 99 per cent of all pharmaceutical products were patented, and domestic Indian drug prices were among the highest in the world.1
  India’s biopharmaceutical industry added further value to ‘the pharmacy of the world’ label through vaccines and biologics. Today, one in three children in the world are immunized with a ‘Made in India’ vaccine2 and it will not be long before one in five insulin users around the world will manage diabetes with an insulin product manufactured in India. It is also prudent to note that the pharmaceutical industry has attracted over $13 billion in foreign direct investment (FDI) between 2000 and 20153 and has provided employment to about 10 million people.
1991: Towards a More Liberal Economic Regime
The new industrial policy announced in July 1991 and the subsequent amendments brought far-reaching changes in the policy regime and a much more liberal attitude towards FDI than ever before in post-Independence India.
  Foreign ownership of up to 51 per cent was allowed through an automatic approval route for the manufacture of bulk drugs and formulations. This ceiling was gradually raised to 74 per cent in 2000 and to 100 per cent in 2001, thus permitting full foreign ownership of Indian pharmaceutical companies. This resulted in several mergers and acquisitions, the most notable being the acquisitions of Ranbaxy by Japan’s Daiichi Sankyo in 2008 for a hefty sum of $4.6 billion and of Piramal Healthcare by Abbott in 2010 for $3.7 billion.
  In addition to easing limits on foreign-equity holdings in the pharmaceutical sector, the government abolished industrial licensing requirements for a majority of drugs, lifted restrictions on the import of bulk drugs, removed technology-transfer clauses and limited the scope of drug-price controls.
  When the drug-price control orders were revised for the first time, way back in 1979, the prices of 347 drugs were fixed. In the second revision, in 1987, the number of drugs under price control was brought down to 142. In 1995, the number got further reduced to seventy-four. In this way, the 1990s witnessed a substantial dilution in the scope of price controls in the industry. (Unfortunately, this trend is now being reversed: in 2016 the government, in its ill-informed wisdom, placed nearly 700 drugs under price control, with an intention to extend this further.)
  The economic liberalization of 1991 also, for the first time, saw the devaluation of the Indian rupee. This marked a major departure from the relatively protectionist trade policies pursued in earlier years that had imposed extensive controls on domestic manufacturing and artificially overvalued the Indian currency. Consequently, the economy transitioned to a market-based exchange-rate regime. This was soon followed by the announcement of the export–import (Exim) policy in 1992 to remove a large number of controls and restrictions, liberalize imports and boost exports with the ultimate aim of leveraging foreign trade as an engine of growth.
  Under the new Exim policy, initiatives like the Export Promotion Capital Goods (EPCG) scheme allowed duty-free import of capital goods, access to foreign technology and tax benefits that would give a competitive edge to Indian manufacturers in the export markets. The policy soon evolved to include export of services. This multipronged export-promotion strategy led to a rise in exports that helped usher in a phase of stable and accelerated growth for the Indian economy.
  Liberalization moved the economy from being a closed-market entity characterized by extensive regulation, protectionism and public ownership, towards an open-market system that relied on fair competition and the private sector to create dynamics that reduced trade controls and resulted in greater efficiency.
  This brought a sea change in the Indian pharmaceutical industry. Exponential investments were made by leading pharmaceutical companies so that they became global players through a combination of rapid indigenous expansion and overseas acquisitions. This process was further augmented in 2005 when India initiated a system of aligning its product patents regime with global standards to implement commitments undertaken under the World Trade Organization (WTO). This helped renew the interest of pharmaceutical MNCs in the Indian pharmaceutical sector.
The Initial Years
My own entrepreneurial journey started more than a decade before the liberalization of the Indian economy. I ventured to create my biotechnology enterprise in 1978 in a hostile environment characterized by bureaucratic red tape and a draconian licence raj, which was unwelcoming towards foreign investment as well as intellectual capital. It was a time when multinational holdings in Indian companies were capped at 40 per cent.
  As a first-time entrepreneur who was attempting to set up a biotechnology-based joint venture with an Irish company, I began the process of applying for government approvals with the Directorate General of Trade and Development (DGTD) in September 1978. My company, Biocon India, was to be a 70:30 JV with Biocon Biochemicals, Ireland. The project proposal was for the production and export of food and industrial enzymes. I was advised by the head of the DGTD under the Ministry of Commerce—the ministry in charge of approving any foreign investment or JV—that the only way to get approval for starting my company would be to have either import substitution or the export element explicitly listed in the project proposal. If both could be listed, chances would be higher. As I went about preparing my project report, I was accosted by touts who offered to do the paperwork for me and get me an approval if I paid a bribe of Rs 10,000, a princely sum in those days. The irony was that I had only Rs 10,000 in my bank to start the company. Frustrated with the demands of the touts, I finally complained to the DGTD chief, who assured me of help with the application and told me that I would get the approval without having to pay any bribe to anyone. I finally submitted my application by the end of October. The listing of the elements of import substitution and export potential aided in expediting the process of getting an approval, and Biocon India was registered on 29 November 1978.
  As a pioneer, I had the advantage of escaping the radar of regulatory scrutiny. Until 1986, biotechnology had no regulator. The fact of being a woman entrepreneur engaged in creating a research-led business added to the mystique. The only regulations that I had to comply with were statutory in nature, covering the Factories Act, labour laws and the prevailing export–import regulations.
  By 1979, Biocon India had become the first Indian company to manufacture and export enzymes to the US and Europe. However, at that time, there were no controls either on importing or exporting biological products, like there are today.
Venture Funding: The Advent of New-age Companies
As an entrepreneur, I had to face funding challenges in the early years. In the 1970s and 1980s, venture capital was virtually non-existent and the only way an entrepreneur could source funds was by raising debt from typically risk-averse lenders. What counted were collateral security, a demonstrated track record in business and a well-understood business model. I did not possess any of these elements: I was a twenty-five-year-old start-up entrepreneur, a woman at that, with no business experience, no collateral security to offer and, worse still, pursuing a high-risk, unknown business based on biotechnology. For the banks, my personal guarantee as the managing director of Biocon India was not enough. They suggested I get my father as a guarantor. I was not ready to accede to the banks’ ridiculous requirement of getting a male guarantor. In 1979, I had to knock on the doors of five banks before a brave banker at the state-owned Canara Bank decided to take the risk and back me by extending a credit line of Rs 3 lakh.
  A year later, I approached the Karnataka State Financial Corporation (KSFC) for a loan to expand the manufacturing capacity. KSFC suggested that I apply under a quota for the disabled, scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and women entrepreneurs. I told them that I would not apply against any quota as a matter of principle. Eventually, KSFC gave me a term loan of Rs 14 lakh to set up a new manufacturing facility on a twenty-acre piece of land on the outskirts of Bangalore. At that time, interest rates were high and getting access to capital was challenging. I was grateful that KSFC provided me with the much-needed capital, albeit at an interest of 16 per cent per annum—which was considered a ‘concessional rate’.
  Ten years later, despite building a successful track record of being able to run a profitable biotechnology business, I was back to square one when I tried to raise a loan to scale up a novel enzyme-fermentation technology based on solid-state fermentation. A decade-long research effort had led to the development of an exciting, home-grown solid-state fermentation technology for the production of fungal enzymes. We had validated the technology in a small pilot plant and were now confident of investing in the technology to take it to a commercial scale. The funding needs, as viewed in the 1980s, were by no means modest; we estimated a cost of Rs 1.15 crore. Conventional lending institutions like the KSFC and the Karnataka State Industrial Investment and Development Corporation (KSIIDC) were extremely reluctant to back such a high-risk venture, especially when most Indian companies relied on imported technologies. KSFC wanted me to obtain a letter from the Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI) validating that I had a feasible technology as a prerequisite for the approval of funds. CFTRI, which had no clue about the technology we had developed, wanted access to the intellectual property (IP) in order to validate it. I obviously refused, as this was proprietary technology and the IP needed to be guarded closely. Both KSFC and KSIIDC refused funding, saying that they did not understand the proprietary technology that I was trying to scale up. I was even advised to license an imported technology in order to get the loan sanctioned. Nobody understood that the whole point of biotechnology was not about the licensing technology but about developing your own IP and innovation-led technology.
  Fortunately, in the late 1980s, the emerging success of the information technology (IT) sector had sown the seeds of venture capital funding in India. Narayanan Vaghul, the visionary chairman of the Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India (ICICI), started India’s first venture capital fund—the Technology Development Investment Corporation of India (TDICI, later rechristened ICICI Ventures)—with the primary objective of providing seed capital to technology-led start-ups. A chance meeting with Vaghul allowed me to attract venture funding from TDICI for my solid-state fermentation project. What was even more rewarding was that it was an equity and not a debt-funding institution. TDICI accordingly took a 20 per cent stake in Biocon in 1989 for Rs 1.15 crore. Biocon was one of the first recipients of venture funding in the biotech sector. This marked a turning point in our business as it enabled financial resourcing in an accretive way. We no longer had to worry about servicing debt.
  Government policymaking also reflected these efforts to foster venture capital and private equity as a source of risk capital for entrepreneurs and innovation. In 1996, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) enacted regulations for venture capital funds that were replaced with regulations for alternative investment funds in 2012. This was conceived as a comprehensive legal framework to regulate venture funds, social venture funds, infrastructure funds, private equity funds, debt funds and hedge funds.
  Venture capital and private equity, which provided an alternative source of financing to a small number of entrepreneurial businesses in the 1990s, have poured over $100 billion into the Indian economy between 2001 and 2014.4
  In the early 1990s, however, the prevailing business ethos favoured low-risk ventures. So much so that when Infosys went public in 1993, its initial public offering (IPO) was undersubscribed because investors were unwilling to bet on an obscure IT services company. The IPO scraped through after Morgan Stanley, the investment banker, picked up 13 per cent of the company’s equity at Rs 95 a share. By 1999, however, Infosys’s share price had rocketed to Rs 8100, making it the costliest share in the market at the time.5
  The mushrooming of technology-led start-ups and small enterprises, fuelled by venture capital, nudged the capital markets into providing alternative avenues of exit. Several attempts in the past, such as the Over-the-Counter Exchange of India, initiated in 1990, had failed to take off due to deficiencies in the regulatory structure. The BSE IndoNext platform, launched in 2007, also failed to attract much market participation. In 2012, the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) launched the BSE SME platform and the National Stock Exchange (NSE) started its ‘Emerge’ platform to provide an alternative source of equity funding to small and medium enterprises (SMEs). It remains to be seen if they will sustain themselves. America’s Nasdaq has proved to be the only successful stock exchange for technology-led enterprises to raise capital. London’s Alternative Investment Market (AIM) has also struggled to build credible value, although in recent times a number of technology companies have listed on it at valuations comparable to those of Nasdaq. Biocon listed on the NSE and BSE in 2004, and commanded a billion-dollar market cap from the start, backed by a premium valuation resulting from its spearheading of a new technology sector—biotechnology.
  Sadly, Biocon’s triumphant debut on the bourses has barely encouraged other biotech companies to follow suit. Regulatory uncertainty and long gestational periods for the commercialization of biotech products have served as deterrents for investors.
Department of Biotechnology: A Regulator and Promoter
Up until the mid-1980s, Biocon was the lone biotech company pursuing a research-and-development (R & D)-led business where every research consumable had to be imported. Whilst the red tape for consumables was manageable, the hurdles at customs to import R & D instrumentation were steep and sometimes impossible to cross. Building Biocon as a company trying to compete in the global marketplace was painful and frustrating. However, it was a matter of time before I saw a few more biotechnology-based companies take root. Soon it was time for the government to take notice.
  In 1982, the government established a National Biotechnology Board with Dr S. Ramachandran as member secretary. The mandate was to identify priority development areas in the field. Soon after, the need for a separate department was felt and the government established the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) in 1986 with Ramachandran as its founder secretary.
  The setting up of the DBT was a decisive step towards creating a road map for biotechnology in India. As a pioneer in the industry, I was privileged to be invited to DBT’s task force. The focus of the first phase was on creating an academic ecosystem for biotechnology and thereby developing the required human capital to support this emerging sector. A number of departments of biotechnology were created at select universities: Anna University, Madurai Kamaraj University, Jawaharlal Nehru University and MS University. In addition, stand-alone institutions had also been created earlier, such as the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) in 1977 in Hyderabad and the Institute of Microbial Technology (IMTECH) in 1984 in Chandigarh.
  The DBT also initiated a regulatory framework for the biotech industry, promulgating guidelines for conducting research and developing products for commercial use. Recombinant technologies were the fulcrum of the regulations, which largely covered vaccines, genetically modified (GM) crops and biopharmaceuticals.
  In 1990, the government set up the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) for the promotion, financing and development of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). SIDBI introduced low-interest debt instruments, which in today’s parlance are like seed funding, that helped companies like ours scale up. In fact, in 1998, SIDBI and the DBT set up a Rs 100-crore biotechnology development fund to promote entrepreneurship in biotechnology.
  The 1990s witnessed the mushrooming of a large number of small and midsized biotech enterprises across the country. As the industry grew, the DBT’s focus expanded to building industry–academia linkages that were critical to enhancing the sector’s value. Biotech clusters developed in Bangalore and Hyderabad, driven by academic centres of excellence such as the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) and CCMB respectively.
  The DBT mirrored the emergence of biotechnology in India, matching every inflection in its journey from a nascent sector to a sunrise industry. By providing specialized skills and financial and regulatory support, the DBT strengthened the bedrock on which the Indian biotech sector built a global, disruptive industry.
Biotechnology and Its Disruptive Impact
The disruptive power of Indian biotechnology innovation grabbed the attention of the world in the late 1990s when the Hyderabad-based Shantha Biotechnics introduced a recombinant hepatitis B vaccine at a fraction of the cost quoted by Western drug makers. Shantha Biotechnics, founded by an engineer, K.I. Varaprasad Reddy, in 1993, was committed to develop affordable vaccines for immunization against several life-threatening diseases. At the time, large multinational pharmaceutical companies held monopolies on the recombinant hepatitis B vaccine, which was priced at over $25 a dose and was thus unaffordable for most Indians. Shantha Biotechnics saw an unmet domestic need and invested in innovation that led to India’s first recombinant hepatitis B vaccine that cost less than $1 a dose. The company was acquired by Sanofi at a valuation of $784 million in 2009.
  Similarly, in 2004, Biocon introduced a recombinant human insulin developed indigenously through a proprietary fermentation technology at a price much lower than that of imported insulin. Today, several Indian companies have developed life-saving biosimilar drugs for cancer, diabetes and autoimmune diseases at world-beating prices.
Biocon: The Transformational Years
As a pioneering biotech enterprise, Biocon had to create the required ecosystem from scratch. We dealt with the infrastructural constraints of the 1980s by developing rather frugal home-grown innovations to scale up enzyme technologies which we managed to export successfully. Once the Indian economy opened up and the infrastructure improved, we focused on embracing cutting-edge technologies, creating a global scale in our manufacturing endeavours, and benchmarked our systems and strategies to the best practices globally.
  In 1989, Unilever acquired Biocon India’s Irish parent, Biocon Biochemicals, and merged it with its subsidiary, Quest International. Biocon, which had functioned as a bootstrapped entrepreneurial company, underwent a transformation. I immediately recognized the advantage of having Unilever, a global conglomerate, as a business partner. It was a unique opportunity to acquire the global best practices and build a ‘Made in India’ label for Biocon, which would become a byword for high quality.
  The economic reforms initiated in 1991 eased the norms for FDI which prompted Unilever to increase its stake and investment in our JV. This, I believe, was a critical inflection point in Biocon’s life cycle. Not only did we adopt international best practices in quality systems and financial reporting but also, more importantly, developed an understanding of intellectual property and patenting skills that catapulted us on to the world stage. By 1993, Biocon India had become the first manufacturing business within Unilever Plc to attain the ISO 9001 accreditation from Germany’s RWTUV.
  Towards the late 1990s, my entrepreneurial restlessness urged me to diversify our business by looking beyond enzymes. The logical progression was to find opportunities in biopharmaceuticals where we could leverage our fermentation and genetic engineering capabilities to develop high-value pharmaceuticals that would provide us with nonlinear growth opportunities. Unilever, however, did not share our diversification strategy and encouraged us to set up a separate entity to realize this dream. In 1998, Unilever unexpectedly announced that it had reached an agreement to sell its speciality chemicals business to another British MNC, ICI (formerly known as Imperial Chemical Industries). This change of control enabled me to buy out ICI. This resulted in Biocon becoming an independent entity in control of its own destiny. We merged our enzymes and biopharmaceutical businesses.
  Our biopharmaceutical journey was technology-driven. We leveraged our proprietary fungal enzymes platform to develop cholesterol-reducing drugs called Statins. We leveraged our genetically engineered technology based on a yeast—Pichia pastoris—to develop a recombinant human insulin. We licensed a mammalian cell-culture technology from Cuba to develop monoclonal antibodies for cancer and autoimmune diseases. Our broad strategic intent was to develop a biopharmaceutical model that addressed chronic diseases, specifically diabetes and cancer. We received our first US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for Lovastatin in 2001—which laid the foundation for biopharmaceuticals.
  When we started our biopharmaceutical journey in 1998, 80 per cent of our business came from enzymes, with the balance being created by biopharmaceuticals, largely statins. By 2004, when we went public, the business mix reversed, with 80 per cent coming from biopharmaceutical and the balance from enzymes. This shift in revenues also led to the divestiture of our historic enzymes business in 2007. Novozymes, our Danish competitors, acquired this business at an innovation premium of 8X of sales, thus validating the IP value creation in our enzyme technologies. Ever since exiting the enzymes business, we have remained steadfast on the innovation path by balancing our biopharmaceutical strategy between biosimilars (generic versions of biologic drugs) on the one hand, and novel programmes on the other. We have commercialized two path-breaking monoclonal antibody drugs; Nimotuzumab for the treatment of head and neck cancer and Itolizumab for psoriasis. Other exciting novel programmes include Tregopil, an oral insulin in a tablet, and Fusion or bispecific antibodies for treating various aggressive cancers. Biocon is recognized as one of the highest R & D spenders in the country with an average of 12–15 per cent of its revenue accounting for it as compared to the national industry average of 5–8 per cent.
  Following on the heels of India’s software services, we also set up a research-services company called Syngene International in 1994 with an array of offerings to support global pharmaceutical, agri-biotech and nutritional companies’ research pipelines. This was timely as it coincided with India signing the WTO agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) in 1995, which provided the comfort and confidence of IP protection that such a business required. Syngene grew rapidly over time to build up competence across the drug development value chain, from discovery to clinical outcome, and served eight of the top ten global pharmaceutical majors. In 2015, Syngene listed on the Indian stock exchange with a billion-dollar market capitalization.
2005: A New Patent Regime
The 1970s saw the Indian government enact a series of policies designed to end the dominance of foreign drug companies and foster self-reliance in basic drugs through local production. The rising protectionism resulted in the Patents Act, 1970, which abolished ‘product patents’ on food, chemicals and drugs to institute ‘process patents’ instead. Process patents allowed Indian companies to ‘reverse engineer’ or copy patent foreign drugs without fear of legal repercussions, as long as they employed a production process that differed from that used by the patent owner. The stated objective of the move was to foster the development of an indigenous Indian pharmaceutical industry and to guarantee that the Indian public had access to low-cost drugs.
  It was also in 1970 that the Drug Price Control Order (DPCO) came into being for the first time. The objective of the DPCO was to cap the profitability of a pharmaceutical business, thereby indirectly controlling the prices of drugs.
  The changes in India’s patent laws allowed the domestic industry to build considerable competencies and offer a large number of generic drugs legally in India at a fraction of the price of drugs sold in the West. India’s pharmaceutical industry grew and prospered in a highly regulated environment with government price controls.
  These actions laid the foundation for a highly competitive pharmaceutical industry. India’s dependence on expensive foreign drugs was sharply reduced and by 1990, local production ensured that the country was self-sufficient in the production of both bulk drugs and finished dosages.
  In 1995, India joined the WTO and acceded to amend its patent laws to meet obligations under the TRIPS agreement following a ten-year transition period. After decades of protectionism, the country decided to reintroduce the TRIPS-compliant ‘product patents’ in 2005. This amendment, in effect, made reverse engineering or copying of patented drugs illegal and granted patent holders a twenty-year monopoly, starting from the date of patent filing. At the same time, India introduced patent safeguards like compulsory licensing—allowed under TRIPS—to protect public-health interests. India’s progressive patent system facilitated a model of local production and entrepreneurship that allowed its generic drugs industry to contribute to improved access to life-saving drugs across the world. Many of India’s leading pharmaceutical producers increased their exports of generic drugs to the US and Western Europe, and entered into research and development agreements, mergers and acquisitions, and other alliances with foreign pharmaceutical firms.
  At the same time, the Indian pharmaceutical industry helped save millions of lives worldwide by bringing down the prices of essential therapies for HIV, TB and cancer by as much as 90 per cent.
  When India joined the WTO in 1995, its pharmaceutical exports were valued at less than $600 million. By 2005, its exports had grown to $3.7 billion and accounted for more than 61 per cent of the industry turnover. Today, the exports have swelled to about $15 billion and account for nearly 30 per cent of the generics sold in US and European markets.
  In the early years of liberalization, prior to India joining the WTO, that is, in the period between 1991 and 1995, FDI flows in drugs and pharmaceuticals averaged a modest $17.2 million per year and cumulatively amounted to just $68.7 million, with $50.5 million of that total occurring in 1993–94. With India’s entry into the WTO in 1995, FDI increased substantially. Between 1995 and 2005, in the course of India’s ten-year transition towards compliance with TRIPS requirements, these FDI inflows averaged $73.7 million annually, a more-than-fourfold increase compared to 1991–95.6
  I took advantage of this evolving liberal economic environment to partner with companies across the globe to establish synergies in research, development and marketing. We were able to grow rapidly through these partnering opportunities. These partnerships have been symbiotic and have enabled Biocon to create leading-edge capabilities as a strong development partner on the one hand, and have opened up global markets on the other.
  Within two decades of establishing the DBT, India became a biotechnology hotspot with the promise of becoming a high-value, low-cost innovator in bio-therapeutics, vaccines, enzyme technologies, GM crops and bioinformatics. By 2006, Shantha Biotechnics and Bharat Biotech had disrupted the MNC monopoly over hepatitis B vaccines not only in India but also all over the developing world with the help of the World Health Organization (WHO). Likewise, Biocon and Wockhardt broke the insulin stronghold that Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly and Sanofi had enjoyed for decades. India’s growth mantra was ‘affordable innovation’, which resonated well at a time when Western drug makers were challenged with spiralling research and manufacturing expenditure that was driving up healthcare costs to unsustainable levels.
2000: A New Millennium and the Advent of Bio-clusters
Recognizing the transformational power of biotechnology, several Indian states in the new millennium took strong initiatives to develop bio-clusters based on intrinsic academic and entrepreneurial strengths. These bio-clusters received fiscal incentives from the DBT and state governments, and featured biotech incubators, biotech parks and centres of academic excellence focused on biosciences.
The Hyderabad Bio-cluster
In 1999, the Government of Andhra Pradesh established a dedicated biotechnology hub near Hyderabad, christened the Genome Valley, which saw a number of midsized companies (like Bharat Biotech) take root. A few years later, in 2002, the government, in collaboration with ICICI, set up a Knowledge Park at Genome Valley, now referred to as IKP. In time, Hyderabad emerged as an important bio-cluster with an academic backbone supported by institutions like CCMB, the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), Osmania University and the Indian School of Business, and with an industry network created by companies like Shantha Biotechnics, Bharat Biotech, Biological E and Dr Reddy’s Laboratories. The presence of a large pharmaceutical industry in Hyderabad caused this bio-cluster to focus largely on vaccines and bio-therapeutics.
The Bangalore Bio-cluster
Bangalore grew to become the country’s largest diversified bio-cluster thanks to active encouragement from the state government, which set up a Vision Group on Biotechnology in 2000 as a public–private partnership (PPP) in order to evolve a pragmatic biotechnology policy for the state. Another key catalyst was the Astra Research Centre, a PPP between Astra, the Swedish pharmaceutical major, and the IISc in Bangalore. This centre spun off two important biotech start-ups promoted by scientist entrepreneurs. First off the block was Bangalore Genei, which was set up to develop and market restriction enzymes critical to recombinant DNA technology. The next was XCyton, a diagnostic company focused on developing recombinant DNA kits for HIV and infectious diseases. The business model was one of import substitution and this localization marked the start of a new phase for the Indian biotechnology sector, speeding up its growth.
  At the start of the millennium, Bangalore became a bustling biotech hub populated with a number of large and small biotech companies. These included Biocon, which is today Asia’s largest biotech enterprise; Strand Genomics, a bioinformatics company started by a research scientist at IISc; GangaGen, a phage-based antibiotic company; ReaMetrix, a whole blood-based diagnostics instrumentation company; Syngene and Jubilant Biosys, which spearheaded research services; bio-IT companies like Genotypic Technology, BigTec and Molecular Connections. The evolving biotech cluster in Bangalore spurred the growth of ancillary biotech companies like Sartorius, a German bioengineering company that started fabricating bioreactors, and Biozeen, which started a business based on good manufacturing practice (GMP) and good laboratory practice (GLP) training modules.
Funding for Innovation
It was becoming evident that biotechnology was a research-led business with long gestational timelines which required infusion of seed funding that could be perceived to be in the realm of risk capital. Between 2005 and 2008, the DBT responded to signals from the nascent biotech industry and initiated two flagship funding schemes—the Small Business Innovation Research Initiative (SBIRI) and Biotechnology Industry Partnership Programme (BIPP)—aimed to provide capital in the form of soft loans and grants for biotech innovation that had crossed the proof-of-concept stage. These two flagship schemes helped ignite the R & D appetite of the Indian biotech industry.
  Earlier in 2001, the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) had initiated the New Millennium Innovation Technology Leadership Initiative (NMITLI) programme, which led to several industry–academia research partnerships and also created the right framework to enable scientists to pursue their entrepreneurial aspirations. Apart from these, various state governments, especially those of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, established innovation funds to address the needs of biotech companies.
  In 2012, the Government of India took a landmark decision to create a unique organization, the Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC), which would consolidate all industry funding schemes.
  BIRAC was a first-of-its-kind initiative with a mandate to strengthen and empower the innovation capacities of biotech entrepreneurs and provide an enabling ecosystem. The mandate given to BIRAC was to focus on a wide range of impact initiatives that straddled risk capital, targeted funding, technology transfer, IP management and other handholding schemes aimed at business scaling. Central to the objectives of BIRAC is to ensure excellence in innovation in biotech companies and make them globally competitive.
The Advent of EOUs
The realization that export promotion could be a key driver of economic growth led India to introduce the Export Oriented Units (EOUs) scheme in the early 1980s. The key objectives were to attract investment for exports, augment production capacity and raise employment. The EOUs enjoyed various duty exemptions on the import of capital goods, raw materials and consumables. However, the biggest attraction of the scheme was the complete income tax exemption on export earnings. These benefits attracted robust investor response and the number of EOUs rose steadily from over 1500 in 2001 to almost 2600 in 2010. Consequently, exports from EOUs rose over fivefold from about Rs 16,000 crore ($3 billion) in FY 2001 to Rs 84,000 crore ($16.5 billion) in FY 2010. The gradual phasing out of the EOUs started in 2011 when critical income tax benefits were withdrawn.7
SEZs Give Exports a Boost
Over time, it was recognized that the EOU model had to be re-engineered in order to address a number of inadequacies linked to the multiplicity of controls and clearances, the absence of world-class infrastructure and an unstable fiscal regime. At the turn of the millennium, the government announced the Special Economic Zones (SEZs) policy in April 2000. The policy aimed to attract foreign investment, boost exports and create new jobs. Central to this was an attractive fiscal package that included phased tax holidays, duty exemptions and minimum regulations. The scheme was launched under the provisions of the Foreign Trade Policy between 2000 and 2006, and fiscal incentives were made effective through relevant statutes.
  A comprehensive Special Economic Zones Act came into effect in 2005. This further simplified procedures and provided for a single-window clearance on matters relating to central as well as state government regulations.
  A number of tax sops were offered under the SEZ scheme in order to make it a profitable proposition for investment. Given the Indian pharmaceutical industry’s strong focus on exports, several leading pharmaceutical and biotech players like Ranbaxy, Wockhardt, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Lupin, Jubilant Life Sciences, Biocon, Divi’s Laboratories, Zydus Cadila and Piramal Healthcare came forward to invest in the setting up of SEZs. The establishment of SEZs enabled both pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies of India to invest in large-scale manufacturing, which, in turn, made the country’s pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical exports globally competitive and also boosted exports.
  As of date, the SEZ policy has witnessed the establishment of over 360 SEZs across the country. The SEZ policy has delivered on its stated objectives by having a multiplier effect in terms of generating employment and exports. In FY15, investors in SEZs availed themselves of approximately Rs 20,000 crore ($3 billion) of tax breaks. In lieu of this, SEZs generated exports worth Rs 5,00,000 crore ($75 billion) in FY15 and the sector collectively employed approximately 1.5 million people.8
Unfinished Reforms Plaguing the Biotech Sector
Whilst economic reforms have indeed unleashed the pent-up economic energy in manufacturing and services across sectors, the biotechnology industry continues to be challenged with the draconian Biological Diversity Act encompassing archaic policies that deter entrepreneurs from engaging in any economic activity which involves genetic derivatives of India’s ecological resources. A number of large and lucrative value-added manufacturing opportunities are present that can leverage India’s biodiversity-based natural resources. However, until the Act is rewritten, this potential will remain trapped in bureaucratic mire. Likewise, regulatory reforms are urgently needed to help realize the true potential of agri-biotechnology. Apart from Bt cotton, which was approved in 2004, not a single GM agricultural crop has been approved in the country. Unwarranted public outcry fuelled by unscientific propaganda spread by anti-GM lobbies has denied India the benefits of new technologies that aim to provide food security to a country that will have the largest population on the planet to feed.
Conclusion
Biocon entered the realm of biopharmaceuticals post the advent of the reforms process of 1991 with the ambition to prove that drug innovation coming out of India was as transformational as that from any other part of the world. There was one crucial difference: our endeavour was to pursue high-end innovation while keeping it affordable and accessible. We have challenged the Western pharmaceutical model of creating monopolistic markets that delivered high margins at low volumes. As a first-generation entrepreneur from the developing world, I was driven by the belief that the pharmaceutical industry has a humanitarian responsibility to provide patients in need with affordable access to essential drugs and to do so with the power of innovation. I wanted to challenge the deplorable reality where only the affluent had access to the best-in-class medicines whereas the rest were deprived of medicines due to lack of financial resources. I remain committed to the democratization of life-saving drugs.
  The last twenty-five years have been transformational for Biocon, mirroring India’s own rapidly advancing economy and improving infrastructure. Our global competitive edge is being built on a strategy of leveraging India’s lower-cost base to deliver high-value but affordable products and services. We have consciously adopted a strategy of being profitably smart and socially good, which have led us to make long-term investments in creating complex, best-in-class biologics and manufacturing capabilities. We have commissioned operations in locations where we can use the advantages of cost, scale and knowledge. Over time, we have successfully developed biotech drugs that are complex and expensive, and previously available only in the West. In doing so, we have brought advanced biopharmaceuticals for chronic diseases to patients in India and other developing countries at price points that make them affordable and thus accessible.
  We see ourselves as a biopharmaceutical company capable of offering the world’s most affordable insulin and immune therapies to diabetic and cancer patients across the world. We also aim to be an innovator from the developing world, addressing unmet medical needs through research and manufacturing excellence that will build global leadership in the course of time.
  I have always believed that innovation should go hand in hand with affordability—it is only when the benefits of research reaches the person on the lowest rung of the economic ladder that it can be considered to deliver true value. That is why my endeavour is to develop blockbuster drugs that are not about a billion dollars but about a billion patients who benefit from them.

The Impact of the 1991 Economic Reforms on Indian Businesses
Narayana Murthy
Post-reforms, businesses are much more in control of their own destiny than before. Thanks to the competition introduced by the entry of MNCs, Indian businesses have stepped up to the plate and demonstrated that they can compete with these world-class MNCs in customer, employee and investor focus.
I will describe in this essay three major and two relatively minor policy changes brought in by the 1991 economic reforms. These changes had arguably the biggest impact on businesses in India. The examples I will use to describe the hurdles these policy changes removed are hilarious. These examples demonstrate how unfriendly India was to businesses prior to the reforms. They vividly describe our former command-and-control economy at its most stifling, outdated, negative, fatalistic and suspicious. These policy changes were not easy to push through. They were anathema to most Indian politicians and bureaucrats who were brought up on the belief that poverty was a virtue, businessmen were crooks, making profit was a sin, and the government was the solution to every problem. These policy changes also took away most of their power and the opportunities to seek rent. Forget about foreigners, even young Indians today do not believe me when I tell them about the bureaucratic red-tape horror stories we went through until 1991.
  It was sometime in December 1989. My friend, who was then the CEO of a small, fledgling software company, was distraught. He had been issued a show-cause notice by the Chennai branch of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Those days, there was no current-account convertibility in India. Every time an Indian businessman had to travel abroad, the person had to apply to the RBI for release of foreign exchange. My friend had applied for permission to spend two days in Paris and one day in Frankfurt to meet his company’s prospects. When he reached Paris, his prospect asked him if they could meet in Frankfurt instead. The result was a swap in my friend’s calendar. Being an honest fellow, he wrote about this change in his tour report (in those days, we had to submit tour reports after every trip abroad to justify the way we’d spent hard currency released by the RBI!). In return, the RBI promptly sent him a show-cause notice to explain why action should not be taken against him for spending one day in Paris and two days in Frankfurt, while the RBI approval was for the other way round!
  In 1981, we decided to start Infosys and applied for a licence to import a DG MV/8000 computer to start a data centre for software export. In a misguided attempt to encourage a low-end, outdated, unusably small computer manufactured by the Electronics Corporation of India, import of more powerful and modern computers was severely controlled those days. Every component of every computer imported by a corporation or by a software-export company was to be approved—down to the model number and the last byte—by a committee of mandarins and professors, neither of whom had much understanding of modern business needs. Generally, these mandarins would haggle on every kilobyte of memory. (Remember that today’s smartphones have 128 gigabytes of memory: one gigabyte is equal to 1 million kilobytes!) It would generally take about twenty visits to Delhi and about two years to obtain the licence, if you were lucky. Of course, once in a while, there would be some rent-seeking by a small section of the bureaucracy. Technology in the US (from where these computers were imported) those days was improving every three months. Our efforts to change the licence to the new model would start the day the licence was given. Of course, trying to change the model number of any component at the time the mandarins were deliberating on the licence application was simply frowned upon. There was fear amongst us that any such request for change may result in our request being rejected. Generally, approval of any such change took about nine months (on the rare occasion when such requests were indeed accepted). The joke was that India was always three generations behind the US in computer technology. In fact, in our case, the entire approval process and modification of the licence to accommodate a new model of disk drives took about fifty visits to Delhi and about three years. Each visit cost us about $1000. So, even before the licence was given, we would have paid a ‘red-tape’ surcharge of $50,000 on a $1,50,000 computer we were supposed to import. Add to this the 150 per cent duty the government imposed on such imports, it was making the import of modern computers three times their cost in the US and, therefore, unviable for any Indian business.
  Since we did not have any computers in India suited to software development, I decided that my six younger colleagues would take up development for our customers in the US itself. There was the question of sending our customers the maintenance allowance every month. The RBI opined that the only way it was possible was if we brought in the foreign exchange first and only then would they release 50 per cent of that amount towards the maintenance allowance! Our argument against this absurdity and insanity fell on deaf years. The result was that I would get the payment from our customer every month, make an application for the maintenance allowance for the next month, and wait in the corridors of RBI for ten days to get 50 per cent of what Infosys had already earned, forget about opening any offices and hiring salespeople abroad to improve sales.
  When we started our operations in Bangalore, we needed a telephone connection for me to be in touch with my colleagues and our customers abroad. Those days, it took five to seven years for a business to get a telephone connection. The joke used to be that half of the urban middle class in India was waiting for a telephone while the other half was waiting for a dial tone! The ultimate insult was the higher priority accorded to a retired government officer for telephone allotment than to an exporting company. No wonder, we did poorly in exports and had hardly two weeks of foreign exchange in 1991.
  This seems absurd today. But that was the state of affairs prior to 1991 when Prime Minister Narasimha Rao decided to unleash the reforms and tasked Dr Manmohan Singh (his finance minister) and P. Chidambaram (his commerce minister) to implement them. The reforms of 1991 brought five fundamental changes that have transformed the country:
1. Introduction of current-account convertibility removed the hurdles for businesses in travelling abroad, opening offices abroad, installing technology abroad, bidding for end-to-end projects, including installation of third-party hardware and software; subscriptions to knowledge services and databases abroad; buying tools and technology for both Indian offices and branches abroad; hiring employees abroad; and hiring consultants from abroad for improving quality, productivity and brand. It meant we were free to acquire companies abroad, enter new markets, get listed on the world’s best stock exchanges and offer hard currency-based employee stock-option plans. In fact, today, there is absolutely no restriction on any current-account transactions. Even in the area of capital-account convertibility, we hardly have any restrictions for corporations. Indian companies have been acquiring companies abroad like never before in the economic history of India. In other words, free access to hard currency for global operational activities helped us to operate as globalized corporations.
2. Abolition of licensing in most areas—including in technology—eliminated the need for Indian companies (including software companies) to run to Delhi and wait in the corridors of Udyog Bhawan several times a month for over two to three years. In fact, I have not been to Delhi to get an import licence approved since 1991. This meant we could spend that time in our boardrooms planning and strategizing. It also meant we could get into new technologies and build services around these technologies quickly. It removed the uncertainty in planning for growth-leveraging new technologies. We could be ahead of our customers in installing state-of-the-art technologies and, thus, compete effectively with our global competitors. The market had become the determinant for our success, rather than patronage from Delhi.
3. The economic reforms brought back the facility for multinational companies (MNC) in technology to own 100 per cent equity in their Indian subsidies. Union Industries Minister George Fernandes, of the Janata government during the period 1977–80, had insisted that every MNC should dilute their equity holding in their Indian subsidiary to 40 per cent. Many MNCs such as IBM, ICL and Coca Cola left India while some like Unilever and Bosch complied. But most technology MNCs were not interested in entering India due to this restriction. India was the loser in this scenario. The Rao government realized this and removed the restriction, allowing MNCs to hold 100 per cent equity in their subsidiary. The result was the entry of leading-edge technology companies such as IBM, Microsoft, Motorola, Oracle, SAP and Accenture. This was a godsend for the Indian software services companies for a very interesting reason: these companies were not competing with us for the market, since we were not focusing on the small-sized software-services market in India. These MNCs were selling their hardware and software products in the Indian market. Our competition with these MNCs was for talent, which these companies were attracting away from us. In fact, one of my friends remarked that fledgling companies such as Infosys would soon need to wind up their operations since companies like IBM would attract our talent. We had three options. First, we could have used NASSCOM, our industry association, to lobby our government to keep the MNCs out. But I believed in competition and, therefore, did not take that option. Second, we could have accepted our fate and resigned to being a small player in the market. This again was not acceptable to us. Third, we could have found out what these extraordinary MNCs did, learn from them and fight the battle on their turf. I am glad we chose the last option. Our analysis showed that employee attraction and retention generally depended on three factors—competitive compensation, good career growth and good workplace environment with modern technology. Thanks to liberalization, we could satisfy all three of these requirements. Since our revenue was low and we could not give competitive salaries, we created one of the world’s best Employee Stock Option Plans (ESOPs) and distributed over 35 per cent of our equity valued at over $15 billion today. This is large even by US standards. We created the country’s first and world’s second software campus with conference rooms, green lawns, libraries, shops, video-conferencing rooms, modern computing and communications technology, a cafeteria and comfortable commuting facilities. Our HR function created career growth paths for employees in every function—technical, sales and business-enabler. In an unaided recall survey among students of engineering schools in the country, our rating—which was zero in 1992—moved to 18 per cent, a full 7 per cent ahead of IBM and Unilever, by 1996. The rest, as they say, is history.
4. The fourth area of liberalization was in the capital markets. Till 1991, an officer called Controller of Capital Issues (CCI) sat in Delhi—which had a very small stock exchange—and decided on the pricing for the initial public offer (IPO) of companies. This officer was a generalist and had no idea what capital markets were. IPO pricing is all about the future prospects of a company—future revenue and future profits. Investors look at the net present value of the future cash flows and decide on the current value of the company. But this officer would be quite uneducated in the technicalities of capital markets and decide the IPO price based solely on past data. The result was very little enthusiasm among entrepreneurs to list their companies on stock exchanges since that would mean giving away a large part of their hard-earned equity to raise small sums. For example, when Infosys went to the CCI in 1990, we were allowed to list our shares (with a par value of Rs 10) at Rs 11. Dr Manmohan Singh realized the folly of this scheme and decided to abolish the office of CCI. He allowed the companies to fix the IPO price based on their future prospects, in consultation with specialized investment bankers. Infosys went public in 1993 with an IPO price of Rs 95.
5. Along with these major reforms that benefitted businesses—particularly those in the IT sector—N. Vittal, the then secretary of the Department of Electronics, pushed the envelope even further by establishing Software Technology Parks (STP) and decentralizing the decision-making of his department. STPs also provided satellite-based data communications to software-export companies so that these companies could connect their computers with customer computers, making it easy to develop and maintain software for customers. STPs also operated as the single window for interaction between software-export companies and the central government. An STP unit is a virtual concept so that each software company could create one on its own premises and derive all its benefits.
In short, these five areas of reforms and a host of others that followed have influenced Indian businesses in a number of ways. First, it enabled our business leaders to spend their time in focusing on customers and markets, and innovation and employees rather than spending their time lobbying in the corridors of Delhi. Second, it removed uncertainty in business decisions forced by bureaucratic delays and whims. In other words, post-reforms, businesses are much more in control of their own destiny than before. Today, there is no climate of helplessness in the boardrooms. The market is the primary determinant of success of companies. Third, reforms reduced the tyranny of rent-seeking and corruption to a large extent. Fourth, these policy changes made it easy for the entry of world-class multinational companies (MNCs). Since Infosys focused those days on global markets, such entry of MNCs did not have any impact on our customer acquisitions. However, over time, the competition for employees heated up. As a result, we had to improve our focus on attracting and retaining top-quality talent. Frankly, this focus on employee attraction and retention is a very important gift of reforms to my company.
  The reforms of 1991 disproved the long-held Indian belief that any major policy change in democratic India requires long deliberations and cannot be implemented in a hurry. They also disproved several other myths that most bureaucrats had held for a long time: for example, most of my civil servant friends believed that the classical theories of economics did not hold good for a large developing country such as India. They believed that slackening the control on foreign-exchange outflows would lead to capital flight. They also believed that economic policy solutions that worked well for smaller East Asian countries would not work in India. The economic progress made by India since 1991 disproves all these myths.
  Let me present some data to demonstrate the benefits of reforms on Infosys business. Between 1982 and 1992, the Infosys revenues grew from a paltry $1,30,000 to $1.5 million, a factor of just twelve on a small base over a period of ten years. However, after the reforms, our revenues have grown from $1.5 million in 1992 to nearly $10 billion in 2016, which is a factor of 6600 over a period of twenty-four years! Today, we are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). We operate in thirty-nine countries and have over 1,70,000 employees belonging to ninety nationalities. We have created over 200 dollar-millionaires and about 20,000 rupee-millionaires through our employee stock-option plans. We have beaten every well-known MNC in India to be voted the best employer, the best-managed company, the best in corporate governance and the best in investor focus. No wonder we pride ourselves as a shining example of all the good things that came out of the economic reforms of 1991.
  My own industry grew from a trifling $100 million in revenue in 1992 to more than $100 billion last year. Prior to the reforms, the country had foreign-exchange reserves of just $600 million, barely sufficient for fifteen days of essential imports. The easing of controls has swelled that kitty to more than $350 billion today. Contrary to the popular belief that any slackening of foreign-exchange controls would deplete our reserves due to illegal capital flight, today, we see more and more Indian companies bringing in larger and larger hard-currency funds into the country through exports. Thanks to global investor interest in Indian companies, our businesses have raised their level of corporate governance. Thanks to the competition introduced by the entry of MNCs, Indian businesses have stepped up to the plate and demonstrated that they can compete with these world-class MNCs in customer, employee and investor focus.
  What are the lessons from the reforms for us, the Indian businesses? There are many. The reforms showed that it is possible to run businesses legally and ethically in India; that it is possible to compete with the best MNCs and succeed; that it is possible to benchmark with the best global practices, improve on them, and create next practices; and that following the best practices of corporate governance will attract the best global investors and enhance our market capitalization.
  What are the major lessons from the 1991 reforms for our politicians and bureaucrats? First, it showed that courage is the first attribute of a great leader. It showed that leaders who believe in the adage ‘a plausible impossibility is better than a convincing possibility’ can indeed achieve extraordinary results. Second, it demonstrated that even in an argumentative and noisy democracy like India, quick and decisive leadership is likely to get accepted better than the prolonged, vacillating and hesitant one. Third, the reforms proved that most of our fears and assumptions that led to the command-and-control economy were wrong. Finally, it reaffirmed that sound economic policies practised by developed nations do work even for a developing country like India.
  The next set of reforms will have to focus on state-level issues such as introducing flexible labour policy, enhancing agricultural productivity, and improving physical infrastructure, the quality of basic and higher education, healthcare, nutrition and housing. Much has been written about them. I will not go into the details here.
  What are the next set of reforms for my own industry—the software-services export industry? Innovation is the key to the success of this industry. Creating new technologies, creating new products for the global user community, and becoming creators of next practices will require innovation. Such innovation will only come from creating a mindset of proactive problem recognition and solving among our children and youth. Such a mindset requires that we revamp our education systems right from the primary level to help our children focus on understanding the nature around them using formal lessons taught in the class, to become curious, and to solve problems around us using what they learn in the classrooms when they enter higher levels of education. Such a transformation is possible only if the government becomes just a standard-setter for education rather than interfering in the affairs of running schools and education. It is somewhat strange that even after twenty-five years of irrefutable data on the benefits resulting from reforms to the industrial sector, we keep arguing about why government should continue to exercise control over education. The sooner the government moves from being a controller to a catalytic regulator of education (primary, secondary and higher education), the better it is for the country. There are umpteen examples of the benefits from such reforms in countries that have performed better than India in education.
  In what way should the Indian software companies improve? The Indian software companies must invest more in R & D to generate new technologies and platforms. They must create organizational structures and invest sufficiently to develop products. If we have to create globally usable products, then the requirements specification and user interface of these products must be defined in the most developed markets with the design and programming work done in India. Given that advances in technology are rapid, we have to invest heavily in continuous training, starting from the entry level.
  Becoming a product company requires that Indian companies invest heavily in creating global brands. A brand is a trust mark. If Indian companies have to create highly impactful and mission-critical products like SAP has done, then we have to raise the trust of our prospects in us. That is why branding becomes very important.
  One area where Indian companies have lagged seriously is in becoming multicultural organizations. I do not know of any globally successful large corporation that is not multicultural. Diversity is very important to enhance innovation. The extreme dependence of Indian software companies on H1-B and L1 types of visas to recruit only Indians does not augur well for the future of Indian companies. Similarly, the Indian software industry is at an early stage in gender diversity, particularly at the senior levels. This has to be corrected with a sense of alacrity.
  The current per capita revenue productivity of Indian companies, at around $60,000 (including the productivity component abroad—also called on-site rates), is low and has to be improved if we want to recruit talent from developed nations, invest in R & D, training and branding. Such a transformation from being reactive techies to consultants who can provide and enhance business value addition requires better revenue productivity. In fact, our smartness lies in demonstrating business-value leverage that we can bring to the table.
  While the initial set of reforms has helped the country improve the lives of middle- and upper middle-class Indians, it has not impacted the poor significantly. We have the largest mass of illiterates in the world. Our agricultural growth rate has come down from 3.2 per cent prior to 1991 to about 2 per cent today. Thus, our villagers have not seen any benefit from the reforms and globalization. The disparity is increasing. While the number of billionaires in India is growing rapidly, the poor are getting poorer. The buzzword today is ‘inclusive growth’. Inclusive growth is about extending the benefits of reforms to the vast majority of Indians who are poor. The hope is that our prime minister is a firm believer in inclusive growth.
  I believe lessons from the 1991 reforms can be used to bring inclusive growth in our society if we understand what the poor want. It is instructive to ponder on the difference in lifestyles of the middle class and the elite in India on one side, and the poor in India on the other. The starkest difference is that the middle class and the elite have very little interface with the government. They mostly use services and facilities—schools, colleges, hospitals, banks and shops—in the private sector, while the poor depend on the government for these services.
  Since the rich and the powerful citizens in India do not use any of the government services except where there is no alternative, these services have remained inefficient and unaccountable. Hence, inclusive growth requires that we do one of two things: keep government services away even from the poor, or bring efficiency, transparency and accountability to government services in India. I believe that neither is an easy task, given the various sociopolitical decisions we have taken in the last seventy years. Hence, we have to devise a hybrid mechanism of privatizing some of these services while improving efficiency, transparency and accountability in those services that cannot be privatized. Nothing short of this will achieve much inclusivity.
  I am an optimist, and I believe that the Indian political leadership, both at the Centre and the state levels, will make these changes happen and make India convert its potential to reality.

5. Deputy governor of the RBI in 1991, and then governor from 1992 to 1997; a major actor in the 1991 rescue process. He later served as chairman of the Twelfth Finance Commission during 2002–05, and chairman of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister, 2005–08 and 2009–14.
6. Montek Singh Ahluwalia has been among the key policy leaders throughout the whole reform period from the mid-1980s. He had been economic adviser to Prime Ministers Rajiv Gandhi and V.P. Singh during 1985–90; he was commerce secretary during 1990–91 when the trade reforms were initiated; secretary, economic affairs, and finance secretary during 1992–98 when most of the fiscal policy and overall macroeconomic reforms were carried out; and deputy chairman of the Planning Commission from 2004–14.
7. I was only one among a whole group of economists who returned to India from the World Bank and IMF during the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s: Arun Shourie, Raja Chelliah, Bimal Jalan, Montek Ahluwalia, Isher Ahluwalia, Jayanta Roy, Shankar Acharya, Arvind Virmani and Ashok Lahiri, all of whom served with distinction in different positions, both inside and outside the government.
8. Then director of the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, which he had founded on return from the IMF. He later served as a member of the Planning Commission from 1985–90; and chaired the Tax Reforms Committee in 1991–93. The recommendations of this committee laid the groundwork for the far-reaching tax reforms carried out in the 1990s.
9. His own role in the implementation of industrial policy reforms is described in Jairam Ramesh’s To the Brink and Back.
10. His lifetime role in Indian economic policy has been portrayed in Deepak Nayyar and Rana Hasan, Shaping India’s Future: Essays in Memory of Abid Hussain (New Delhi: Academic Foundation, 2017).
11. Our association continued over the years. As chairman of the Expert Committee on Small-Scale Enterprises in the late 1990s, he again asked me to be the member secretary of this committee. The report of the committee was very influential in the eventual de-reservation of small-scale industries, the last of which finally occurred in 2015.
12. Jayanta Roy had first come back from the World Bank to work in the Planning Commission during 1978–80. It was his example that paved my way into the Planning Commission in 1980. He returned in 1988 to join the commerce ministry where he contributed actively to trade policy reforms in the 1990s.

Both Lovraj Kumar and Vijay Kelkar were influential as petroleum secretaries. Vijay attempted very significant petroleum-sector reforms in the late 1990s, which were eventually stillborn as documented by Vikram Mehta in this volume. Vijay Kelkar later contributed to fiscal policy reforms in the 2000s as chairman of an influential tax policy committee in 2002–04 and to Centre–state fiscal relations as chairman of the Thirteenth Finance Commission from 2007–10. Yoginder Alagh served in various capacities, ascending to the post of minister of planning in the late 1990s.

31. Another member of the small bunch of long-serving economic policy mandarins, Bimal Jalan returned to India from the World Bank in the early 1970s and served the government in the industry ministry, finance ministry, Planning Commission and as governor of the RBI (1997–2003).
32. Nitin Desai served in the Planning Commission from the early 1970s to the late 1980s. He was later undersecretary general of the United Nations.
33. This document is now very difficult to find even though it was formally announced in the Indian Parliament. Fortunately, Arvind Panagariya has reproduced it in full as Appendix 1 (455–59) in his book India: The Emerging Giant (New York: Oxford University Press, 2008).
34. Indian Trade Classification based on the Harmonized System of Coding (ITC-HS) is used in India for classification of imports and exports. The first group of items happens to be animals and animal products. Hence this entry.
35. A career generalist bureaucrat from the Indian Administrative Service.
36. Former economic adviser in the Ministry of Commerce (1983–85), long-time professor of economics at the Jawaharlal Nehru University, and later vice chancellor of Delhi University (2000–05). His view of the economic reforms is available in Economic Liberalization in India: Analytics, Experience and Lessons (Calcutta: Orient Longman, 1995).
37. These policy differences led to their departure from the finance ministry in late 1991, with Montek Singh Ahluwalia becoming secretary of economic affairs (later finance secretary), and Ashok Desai, a former colleague of Dr Manmohan Singh at Cambridge, succeeding Deepak Nayyar.
38. Montek Ahluwalia has given a broader account of the 1991 reform process in his contribution to this book. As he describes, and unbeknownst to me at the time, similar and more comprehensive reforms had been advocated in his own so-called secret ‘M document’ that he had been tasked to prepare in the PMO by V.P. Singh.
39. Then minister of health and family welfare, and old Nehru-Gandhi family loyalist.
40. Then minister of human resource development.
41. Along with Dr Manmohan Singh, a key economic policy reformer. Led trade-policy reforms as commerce minister (1991–92 and 1995–96) and the continuation of macroeconomic reforms as minister of finance during 1996–98, 2004–08 and 2012–14.
42. Attached as Annex 1 is the first part of the 1991 Industrial Policy Statement. Paragraphs 1 to 8 constitute the main new parts of the preamble.
43. Later Indian ambassador to the United States.
44. Now deputy chairman of the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian Parliament
45. For this reason, the 1991 Industrial Policy Statement is usually thought of as part of the Budget speech.
46. I had lobbied hard (with stout support from Montek) for this restriction to be limited to cities of above 4 million only, but had to compromise!
47. It was only in 2016 that a bankruptcy Act was finally put in place. It is still to be implemented.
48. We had not had the courage to make this radical proposal. We had only proposed to increase the threshold limit to Rs 1000 crore (Rs 10 billion, $500 million at the July 1991 exchange rate). The then minister for company affairs, R. Kumaramangalam, asked us what the rationale for this number was. We had no answer, so he said, ‘Abolish it!’
49. The relevant passage: ‘A special Empowered Board would be constituted to negotiate with a number of large international firms and approve direct foreign investment in select areas. This would be a special programme to attract substantial investment that would provide access to high technology and world markets. The investment programmes of such firms would be considered in totality, free from predetermined parameters or procedures.’
50. The 2017 Budget speech of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley finally announced its abolition.

58. Expert Group on Commercialization of Infrastructure Projects, Indian Infrastructure Report (New Delhi: NCAER, 1996).
59. A civil servant member of the economic reform team, N.K. Singh has served almost continuously in the Government of India since the early 1990s. He was the chief interlocutor with the IMF and the World Bank during the 1991 crisis-management period. He later served as secretary of the departments of expenditure and revenue in the late 1990s. As secretary to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, he contributed to the continuity of economic policy during the early 2000s. He made a major contribution in the conceptualization of the National Highway Development Project that ushered in the long-lasting investment programme for four-lane highways. He continued the economic policy thrust on infrastructure as a member of the Planning Commission during 2002–04. Most recently, he chaired the committee on Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management to recommend new fiscal rules.
60. Another member of the long-serving band of civil servant/economist technocrats, Y.V. Reddy was chairman of the Fourteenth Finance Commission during 2012–14. He was instrumental in recommending the large increase in the share of taxes to be devolved to the states. He served in the finance ministry at the time of the economic crisis in 1991 and had a significant role in managing India’s external debt at that time. After serving briefly as banking secretary, he became deputy governor of the RBI during 1997–2002, where he instituted significant reforms in the then moderate policy framework and debt management. He rose to become governor of the RBI during 2003–08 when his sagacious policies preserved financial stability in the country, which served well during the North Atlantic financial crisis. I had the unenviable task of succeeding him as deputy governor in 2002.
61. Martin Wolf is chief economics commentator for the Financial Times. His interest in India began in the 1970s when he worked as an economist on the India desk of the World Bank, intentionally writing a book on Indian exports.
62. Shyam Saran has been a distinguished foreign-service officer who rose to be foreign secretary during 2004–06. He advised the prime minister on foreign policy and defence issues during 1991–92 when the economic reforms were initiated. As foreign secretary and later as adviser to the prime minister, he has had a special role in shaping Indian nuclear policy, particularly in negotiating the Indo-US nuclear deal. He was also special envoy of the prime minister on climate change.
63. After serving in the most sensitive posts as the Indian ambassador to China and high commissioner to Pakistan, Shivshankar Menon succeeded Shyam Saran as foreign secretary in 2006 and was later national security adviser to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. He also had a major role in implementing the Indo-US nuclear deal.
64. As an economist and journalist, Sanjaya Baru has actively observed and analysed Indian economic and security policy since the early 1990s. He was my colleague and the only other economist member of the first National Security Advisory Board set up by Prime Minister Vajpayee after the 1998 nuclear test. He later served as Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s media adviser and chief spokesman in his first term during 2004–08.
Chapter 2: India’s 1991 Reforms: A Retrospective Overview
1. Research assistance in the preparation of this paper was provided by Utkarsh Patel and is gratefully acknowledged.
2. The exim scrip system was equivalent to a dual exchange-rate system and was substituted by a dual exchange rate on 1 March 1992.
3. See Ahluwalia (2016).
4. This has obvious costs, because the benefits of reforms are delayed, and it also gives those opposed to the reforms more time to mobilize against them. However, one can imagine a conscious choice being made in favour of this approach, on the grounds that a fuller discussion allows a broader consensus to develop.
5. Prior to the Tendulkar poverty lines, the Government of India was working with the Lakdawala Poverty lines established in 1978 and periodically updated for inflation. Responding to complaints that these poverty lines were too low, the government appointed a committee under Suresh Tendulkar to recommend a new poverty line. For a fuller background on these developments, see Datta (2015).
6. The low growth in the labour force reflects a decline in the participation rate of female workers, much of which was due to the increase in retention of girls in school.
Chapter 3: Remembering 1991 . . . and Before
1. Incidentally, the reason why Delhi witnessed so much arson after Indira Gandhi’s killing has everything to do with who got ration shop licences, and the date of her death. In India then, as now, ration shops were allotted to politically connected people of the locality. Not surprisingly, most ration shops in Delhi in 1984 were operated by Congress supporters. In Model Town, Delhi, henchmen of Congress’s H.K.L. Bhagat got the ration-shop licences for groceries and kerosene. Now the date. Indira Gandhi was killed on 31 October 1984. All the kerosene ration shops were fully stocked, ready for distribution on 1–2 November. It was all too easy to divert this kerosene to burn Sikh houses and families.

5. These were (i) coal and lignite; (ii) petroleum and its distillates; (iii) alcoholic drinks; (iv) sugar; (v) animal fats and oils; (vi) cigars, cigarettes and other tobacco products; (vii) asbestos and its products; (viii) plywood and other wood-based articles; (ix) raw hides, skins and leather, including tanned or dressed fur skins; (x) motor cars; (xi) paper and newsprint; (xiii) electronically controlled aerospace and defence products; (xiii) industrial explosives; (xiv) industrial explosives and hazardous chemicals; and (xv) drugs and pharmaceuticals according to the drug policy. Some of these seem absurd today. But the pruning was truly revolutionary at the time.
6. The restricted list comprised (i) arms, ammunition, defence equipment, aircraft and warships; (ii) atomic energy; (iii) coal and lignite; (iv) mineral oils; (v) mining of iron ore, manganese ore, chrome ore, gypsum, sulphur, copper, lead, zinc, tin, molybdenum, wolfram, gold and diamond; (vi) minerals required for atomic energy; and (vii) railways, including railways transport.
7. The words were new. But not the sentiments. V.P. Singh had issued dire warnings and made similar hardnosed statements about the ill health of the economy in his second budget for 1985–86. The difference lay in the circumstances. With an absolute majority of 414 Lok Sabha seats out of 514, Rajiv Gandhi believed the world was his oyster and that nothing could come in the way of modernizing India, least of all trivial stuff such as fiscal or current-account deficits. July 1991 was an altogether different story. Economic desperation and going around the world with a begging bowl forced the government to think of measures that would have been inconceivable six years earlier.

Chapter 6: Trade-policy Reform in India since 1991
1. I thank Rakesh Mohan for his detailed comments, and Arvind Subramanian, Geethanjali Nataraj and Ramandeep Singh for their comments and discussions.
2. See, for example, the data in https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?queryid=66237.
3. Trade in services is classified in four different categories based on the manner in which services exports take place. This differs from the conventional situation of goods trade that involves the exported product crossing the border into the territory of import. These four different categories are referred to as four ‘modes’ of services exports, and are specified in Article 1.2 of the WTO’s General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), which states: ‘For the purposes of this Agreement, trade in services is defined as the supply of a service: (a) from the territory of one Member into the territory of any other Member; (b) in the territory of one Member to the service consumer of any other Member; (c) by a service supplier of one Member, through commercial presence in the territory of any other Member; (d) by a service supplier of one Member, through presence of natural persons of a Member in the territory of any other Member.’ The classifications under ‘a’ to ‘d’ in this definition are respectively referred to as Modes 1 to 4 of services exports.
4. For India’s services content of different exports categories, see Figures 10 and 11 of ‘Trade in Value Added: India’, OECD, 2015, https://www.oecd.org/sti/ind/tiva/CN_2015_India.pdf.
5. See Abstract and page 3 of Rainer Lanz and Andreas Maurer, ‘Services and Global Value Chains—Some Evidence on Servicification of Manufacturing and Services Networks’, WTO Working Paper ERSD 03, 2 March 2015.
6. See https://www.tpp.mfat.govt.nz/text. With strong anti-TPP positions taken by President-elect Trump, the possibility of implementing TPP is now out of question. However, the issues covered by TPP are those that the US industry wants to address in a trade agreement, and they are likely to re-emerge after a few years to help pave the way for a similar trade agreement.
7. See, for example, paragraphs 2 to 5 of the 1991–92 Budget speech, http://indiabudget.nic.in/bspeech/bs199192.pdf.
8. See paragraph 11 of the Budget speech.
9. Software, processed minerals, leather, certain capital goods, TCMTB and PCMC, polyurethane film and foil, polyols, isocyanates, tourism exports encouraged by lower duty on adventure sports equipment, and 100 per cent export-oriented units.
10. There was a Tariff Commission even before the present one was established in September 1997. The present Tariff Commission was established by giving a new mandate, which included the core mandate of erstwhile Bureau of Industrial Costs and Prices (BICP), and some additional tasks relating to making ‘recommendations as an expert body, on matters referred to it by government regarding fixation of tariff and all tariff-related issues in relation to trade in goods and services, keeping in view the interest of various sectors including production, trade and consumers and taking into account the international commitments.’ See http://tc.nic.in/History.pdf.
11. This Budget speech, which introduced trade-policy reform, was given on 24 July 1991.
12. See paragraphs 111 to 114 of the 1991 Budget speech. The Budget also mentioned objectives such as environment protection.
13. Chelliah Committee Final Report on Tax Reforms, Part II, January 1993, 1, http://111.93.33.222/RRCD/oDoc/TR_Ccr_93.pdf.
14. These categories excluded petroleum products and agriculture subject to quantitative restraints, and non-essential goods that are banned. The categories were dealt with separately in the proposals.
15. five per cent for essential goods; 10–15 per cent for basic raw materials; 20 per cent for capital goods and parts; 25 per cent for chemical intermediaries; 30 per cent for final products; and 50 per cent for non-essential consumer products. The committee also recommended the possibility of a time-bound surcharge on imports.
16. To get a quick idea on some of the changes in India’s customs duties, see ‘India: Selected Issues’, IMF Staff Country Report Number 98/112, IMF, 1998, 11, 15 and 16, https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/1998/cr98112.pdf.
17. See paragraphs 102–129 of the 1996–97 Budget speech, and 123–141 of the 1998–99 Budget.
18. Paragraph 122 of the 1998 Budget speech. For the changes made, see paragraphs 123–147 of that speech.
19. In the case of the United States, paragraph 9 on page 46 of the WTO’s Trade Policy Review, Secretariat Report 1996 (WT/TPR/S/46), states: ‘From 1 January 1995, zero MFN rates were applied [by the US] to 18.3 per cent of all tariff lines, as compared to 15.3 per cent of all tariff lines in 1992. Eighty-three per cent of tariff lines (including ad valorem equivalents) have tariff rates of 10 per cent or less and 3.8 per cent of tariff lines are subject to rates above 20 per cent. Tariff escalation is not a major feature of US trade policy. However, tariff peaks at above 15 per cent are concentrated in agricultural, food and tobacco products, as well as in textiles and footwear; above-quota tariffs on tobacco (reflecting tariffication) are as high as 350 per cent.’
20. Paragraph 77 of the speech. Alcoholic beverages and baggage remained the exception in other years as well when maximum tariff rates were reduced.
21. Thus, Indian announcement of a peak-rate reduction is different from the general use of the term ‘peak tariff’ which denotes the highest tariff levels in the tariff schedule.
22. This includes Thailand (11.6 per cent), Cambodia (11.2 per cent), Laos (10 per cent) and Vietnam (9.5 per cent).
23. An important reason for the increase in weighted average tariffs in 2015–16 was the decline in the import share of petroleum (a low-tariff item), due to the oil price decrease.
24. For imports, see Trade Profiles 2016, WTO, 378; for customs revenue, see Historical Tables of the US Government, Office of Management and Budget, Fiscal Year 2017, Table 2.5. For the latter, see https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2017/assets/hist.pdf. For the former, see https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/booksp_e/trade_profiles16_e.pdf.
25. Non-agriculture tariff lines account for 86 per cent of India’s total tariff lines.
26. See ‘Will the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement Reshape the Global Trade and Investment System? What’s In and What’s New: Issues and Options’, Global Agenda Council on Trade and FDI, World Economic Forum, 2016, 6, 7.
27. Any decrease in current tariff of the high-tariff item—say the tariff falls by 1/X times—will require a multiple of ‘X times’ increase in imports of the product concerned, say, ‘Y’ times, where Y/X is greater than one, for the overall average tariff to rise. Even in that situation, the increase in overall tariff would be mitigated by the very small import share of the product, i.e., the average total tariff would increase by a very small fraction of Y/X. Furthermore, such situations are also valid for the other countries with very low average tariffs, in that they too have some products with high tariffs.
28. See World Tariff Profiles, 2016, 81 and 175, for the spread of tariffs in the EU and the United States. https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/booksp_e/tariff_profiles16_e.pdf.
29. For more details on ‘ceiling binding’, see R. Sharma, ‘Preparing for Negotiating Further Reductions of Bound Tariffs’, FAO. For a comparison of India’s ceiling bindings with other developing countries, see Table 2 of this article. http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/x7353e/X7353E02.htm.
30. If there is a BOP problem, then Article XVIII(b) of GATT allows developing countries to breach commitments under WTO and impose higher trade restrictions than allowed under WTO under normal conditions without the BOP problem.
31. The maximum period for implementing the decrease in the relevant tariffs following loss in the dispute was 1 April 2001. See https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds90_e.htm.
32. India’s trade weighted average MFN tariff in 2015 was 47.2 per cent for agriculture and 4.9 per cent for non-agriculture. See WTO, ITC and UNCTAD, World Tariff Profiles, 2106, 96.
33. These include chapters 1–24 of the HS nomenclature.
34. The definition of agriculture is as used by the WTO in its data on World Tariff Profiles.
35. Final Report, 4. It is interesting that the committee recommended not to have any zero duties. In the world of today with free trade areas and a recognition of the importance of imports in both domestic and international value chains at a time of intense international competition, this would seem to be a proposition that would need reconsideration.
36. See Montek S. Ahluwalia, ‘Economic Reforms in India since 1991: Has Gradualism Worked?’, The Journal of Economic Perspectives 16, no.3 (2002): Table 3, 67–88.
37. This CVD is different from the countervailing (or anti-subsidy duties) that are imposed to counter the adverse effects of subsidized imports that cause material injury to domestic industry.
38. This is imposed under section 3, sub-section 1 of the Customs Tariff Act, 1975. For an explanation, see page 1 onwards of the Act given in the General Notes section in http://www.cbec.gov.in/resources//htdocs-cbec/customs/cs-tariff2015-16/cst-act-2015-16.pdf.
39. ‘Under the Cenvat Scheme, a manufacturer of final product or provider of taxable service shall be allowed to take credit of duty of excise as well as of service tax paid on any input received in the factory or any input service received by manufacturer of final product.’ See http://www.archive.india.gov.in/business/taxation/modvat.php.
40. This is imposed under section 3, sub-section 5 of the Customs Tariff Act 1975. For an explanation, see page 5 onwards of the Act given in the General Notes section in http://www.cbec.gov.in/resources//htdocs-cbec/customs/cs-tariff2015-16/cst-act-2015-16.pdf

42. For more details, see Pami Dua and Rajiv Ranjan, ‘Exchange Rate Policy and Modelling in India’, RBI Development Research Group, Study Number 33.
43. NEER value declined when the value of the rupee decreased in relation to the basket of foreign currencies.
44. Tariffs above 10 per cent are only for 14.8 per cent of the total lines. Of these, 9.7 per cent of the tariff lines are in the range of 25 to 30 per cent.
45. See, for example, the tariff changes introduced by the 2016 Budget in the Table from page 53 onwards in http://indiabudget.nic.in/ub2016-17/bs/bs.pdf and the tariff schedules given in http://www.cbec.gov.in/htdocs-cbec/customs/cs-tariff2015-16/cst2015-16-idx.

50. See ‘Free Trade Agreements. Frequently Asked Questions’, Department of Commerce, Government of India, 9 April 2014, 4.
51. In this context, it is worthwhile to recall the analysis earlier in the paper to show that reduction of tariffs for high tariff items will not likely increase the average trade-weighted tariff in a major way.
52. WTO Dispute, DS90. See https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds90_e.htm.
53. For a list of the consumer goods allowed without restrictions, see India: Trade Policy Review 1993 Report, Secretariat, WTO, 75–76.
54. The other products included precious, semi-precious and other stones; safety, security and related items; seeds, plants and animals; pesticides and insecticides; electronic items; drugs and pharmaceuticals; chemicals; articles related to the small-scale sector; miscellaneous items; and special items required by hotels, restaurants, and sports and recreational bodies. See Trade Policy Report, Secretariat, WTO, 1993, 72.
55. These are milk and milk products, chocolates and chocolate products, and candies/confectionary/food preparations with milk or milk solids as an ingredient.
56. The list of prohibited and restricted imports can be seen at http://dgft.gov.in/exim/2000/download-ftp1213.htm.
57. Details on these latter set of restrictions are provided in ITC (HS); Schedule 1, Import Policy; Appendices I and II; Appendix III specifies the products subject to mandatory BIS certification. While the appendices provide a summary information on these aspects, tariff-line-level treatment for different products can be seen from the links at this website to each chapter of the Indian Trade Classification (ITC).
58. The duties were on PVC imports from Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Korea and the United States.
59. From 2008–09, the average number of anti-dumping initiations has been thirty-eight; the mode and median averages for anti-dumping initiations during this period are thirty-four initiations.
60. It is noteworthy that India has filed nine disputes-settlement cases as complainant, against the anti-dumping actions of others. Following the principles of good governance will generate a stronger basis for India to demand similar treatment of its exports by others.
61. The WTO Committees on SPS and TBT discuss both new and old STCs (i.e., those still to be adequately addressed and remain a matter of concern). For TBT, see WTO Document G/TBT/Rev./1, Chart 19. For SPS, see G/SPS/GEN/204/Rev.16, Table 1.1.
62. One example is the ZED scheme of Quality Council of India, which takes an SME from its present capability level to global standards in five sequential steps.
63. For the list subject to export taxes and exemptions to these taxes, see http://www.cbec.gov.in/resources//htdocs-cbec/customs/cs-tariff2015-16/sch2-exptariff.pdf.

68. There is some evidence that services-trade flows are adversely affected both by trade restrictiveness on services as well as regulatory heterogeneity. See H.K. Nordås, ‘Services Trade Restrictiveness Index (STRI): The Trade Effect of Regulatory Differences’, OECD Trade Policy Papers, no. 189 (2016), Paris: OECD Publishing, http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jlz9z022plp-en.
69. For a discussion, see Joint United Nations Regional Commissions, Trade Facilitation and Paperless Trade Implementation Survey 2015; and Global Report, the United Nations. The OECD includes the following components: advance rulings, appeal procedures, fees and charges, formalities, documents, automation, procedures, internal border agency cooperation, governance and impartiality, information availability, and involvement of the trade community.

73. Examples include continuing with the implementation of the Indian Customs Single-Window Project, allowing deferred payment of customs duties for importers and exporters with proven track record, and shift from physical control to record-based control for customs-bonded warehouses, supported by sophisticated IT systems.
74. For certain trade facilitation components, India’s performance is better than the country with the best global overall performance (e.g. for advance rulings) or equal to the best overall performance country (e.g. for internal border agency cooperation or information availability). For some other components, however, India is substantially below the average for Asia (e.g. fees and charges and procedural formalities). See ‘OECD Trade Facilitation Indicators—India’.

Chapter 12: Union–State Relations and Reforms
1. The author is grateful to G.R. Reddy, adviser, Government of Telangana; Pinaki Chakraborty, professor at National Institute of Public Finance and Policy; and V. Bhaskar, former special chief secretary, finance, Government of Andhra Pradesh, for their valuable assistance and advice on the subject.

3. For details, see ‘Annual Report, 2015–16’, Reserve Bank of India, 2016, Appendix Table 6: Key Fiscal Indicators, 175.
4. The Eighty-eighth Amendment (2004) introduced Article 268A, amended Article 270 and introduced Article 92C of the Union List—tax on services. These explicitly provided for the levy of service tax by the Centre and its sharing with the states. All these three provisions were deleted by the recent Constitution 101 Amendment (GST) Act.
5. Through the back door in the Finance Bill. It has continued to do so till today. Regrettably, there is no substantive service-tax law in place today. All components of service-tax law are found only in various finance bills.
6. Only input tax paid in that state through upstream purchases. CST is still not set off as well as other taxes such as purchase tax, agricultural mandi tax and entertainment tax.
7. The Forty-second Amendment brought in forests, population control and family planning, and) education into the Concurrent List. The Seventh Amendment brought in ‘Acquisition and Requisition of Property’ into the Concurrent List. Welfare of labour, trade unions, social security were always in the Concurrent List (even in the Government of India Act 1935). Perhaps, these areas are good places to start such examinations.

Chapter 14: 25 Years of Policy Tinkering in Agriculture
1. Indian currency still is, according to Bhagwati, Barua and Khan (2015), overvalued. The rupee’s trade-weighted real effective exchange rate is 26 per cent overvalued as of March 2015 compared to 2004–05.
2. Revealed comparative advantage is an index that estimates a country’s relative advantage or disadvantage in a certain class of goods or services as evidenced by trade flows. Based on the Ricardian comparative advantage concept, it most commonly refers to an index introduced by Béla Balassa (1965): RCA = (Eij/Eit)/(Enj/Ent), that is, the RCA is equal to the proportion of the country’s exports that are of the class under consideration (Eij/Eit) divided by the proportion of world exports that are of that class (Enj/Ent).
3. Relative prices index between agriculture and manufacturing is taken from Economic Survey, Government of India.
4. The result of a simple linear regression model: Log AGDP = 1.575 + 0.582 Log PR (T-1) + 0.341 Log RNI + 0.12 Log Trend, with ‘t’ values as (4.9), (2.4) and (5.4) respectively. The Adjusted R square is 0.913. The equation is the result of an extensive quantitative exercise undertaken by authors in Gulati, Saini and Jain (2013).

Chapter 24: Changes and Challenges: Corporate India since 1991
1. In November 1993, eight industrialists (Bharat Ram, Lalit Thapar, Hari Shankar Singhania, M.V. Arunachalam, B.K. Modi, C.K. Birla, Rahul Bajaj and Jamshyd Godrej) delivered a note to Manmohan Singh. It welcomed competition in the product markets, but obliquely urged the government to take steps to enable Indian businesses to play their rightful role in India’s industrial development—a shorthand for putting a brake on entry of foreign companies and on tariff cuts. Thankfully, the government did not take this too seriously. See Bhupesh Bhandari, Business Standard, 8 July 2011.

1. The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) is an international agreement administered by the World Trade Organization (WTO) that sets down minimum standards for many forms of intellectual property (IP) regulation as applied to nationals of WTO Members.
Chapter 26: India’s National Innovation System: Transformed or Half-formed?
1. For a lower-middle income labour-surplus country.
2. A study independently carried out by Moses Abramovitz and Robert Solow.
3. Although the contribution of technical change to economic growth is well appreciated, it is still calculated as the residual in Total Factor Productivity calculations, after subtracting the contribution of capital and labour.
4. The concept of National Innovation Systems is derived from books by Richard Nelson (1993) and Bengt-Åke Lundvall (1992).
5. Total global R & D in nominal terms for 2014–15 was calculated using nominal GDP data from the IMF World Economic Outlook Database, April 2016, https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2016/01/weodata/index.aspx; GERD as a percentage of GDP from UNESCO Institute for Statistics, UIS.stat, http://data.uis.unesco.org/. The figure for total industrial R & D was obtained from the EU Industrial R & D Investment Scoreboard (2015). Figures in euros were converted to dollars using the EUR–USD exchange rate of 1.21 as of 31 December 2014, as mentioned in the EU Industrial R & D Investment Scoreboard.
6. EU Industrial R & D Investment Scoreboard (2015); Centre for Technology, Innovation and Economic Research.
7. The term ‘Newly Industrializing Countries’ almost always includes the eight countries of Table 1 plus Malaysia and Indonesia. Turkey, South Africa and Hong Kong are also often included and, on occasion, Chile, Argentina, Colombia, Egypt and Vietnam.
8. There is a difference in many countries between who funds and who does research. In most major economies, the State funds the bulk of research undertaken in universities, whether public or private. In some economies like the US, Israel and the UK, the State also funds a substantial part of the defence research expenditures of private industry. In India, there is essentially no gap between who funds and who does research: publicly funded research is done in government laboratories (overwhelmingly) or in government higher-education institutes (to a minor extent). Private industry funds the great bulk of its own R & D.
9. There is a serious problem with Indian R & D statistics. No government agency can provide overall data. The Centre for Technology, Innovation and Economic Research estimates that if we include contract R & D done in India for foreign firms in total, the R & D share as a percentage of GDP would rise to 1.2 per cent, with the public and industry shares at fifty-fifty and the industry share, in turn, splitting roughly equally between R & D done for use within the country and as contract R & D that is exported.

17. See Keith Pavitt, ‘The social shaping’.
18. My most telling example is that of Great Britain. Britain was a net importer of technology throughout its heyday as the world’s workshop (on exhibit at the Crystal Palace in 1853). It was only in the latter half of the 19th century that Britain became a net exporter of technology, at about the time that relative industrial decline set in.
19. See Kochhar et al., ‘India’s Pattern of Development: What Happened, What Follows?’, Working Paper WP/06/22 (Washington: International Monetary Fund, 2006), 22. This paper is worth reading both for its outstanding content and for the co-authors, including Raghuram Rajan and Arvind Subramanian. Note also that the China comment reflects when the paper was written, in 2006. Today, ten years later, as wages have risen, Chinese industry has become more skill-intensive and we see the investment in R & D we discussed earlier.
20. Hope springs eternal!
21. If our R & D statistics are of poor quality and out-of-date, our employment data is simply awful. For example, the total registered employment in the country in construction is 1,20,000 and in retail 6,00,000. If manufacturing employment is as under-reported, then all is robust and healthy!

26. In our book, From Followers to Leaders, Dave Wield and I argue that firms should build the capability of pushing out the design frontier within a particular technological paradigm. Our argument was that the design and technology frontiers were distinct, and that pushing out the design frontier was an attractive way of adding value in products without the risk involved in attempting to push out the technology frontier: in other words, let the world’s rich firms make the expensive mistakes. But building design leadership takes serious investment in skills and building R & D competences, which few Indian firms have today.
27. Many in the software industry would argue with my use of the term ‘labour arbitrage’ today, pointing to the substantial capabilities built up in large-scale project management and execution excellence. I agree, but what share of our total software sector would exist if we needed to pay salary levels local to the market?
28. See Roger Noll, ed. Challenges to Research Universities (Washington DC: Brookings, 1998), 18. The emphasis is mine. The quote is from his introductory chapter, ‘The American Research University: An Introduction’.
29. Ibid. The emphasis is mine. The policies that affect the building of technical capability most fundamentally are beyond those specifically concerning technology. Trade Policy and openness are usually more important than Research Policy. Education Policy affects a firm’s ability to build technical capability more directly than a tax subsidy for carrying out R & D.
