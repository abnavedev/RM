Preface
This book should have been published in 2016 when the country completed twenty-five years of economic reforms. That was our intention, but it was clearly too ambitious to expect success in producing such a book within eight months of the inception of the idea. But, better late than never.
I have been fortunate to have had the opportunity to serve the Government of India in a host of different capacities throughout the reform period from 1991 until late 2015. For a professional economist, nothing can be more exciting and gratifying than being part of a policy process that sets a country on a sustainable growth path that lasts over a long period. India has already grown at an average annual rate of around 6.5 per cent for almost thirty-five years. This was a significant acceleration over the anaemic rate of 3–3.5 per cent over the previous thirty-five years. We can hope that such a process will continue and even accelerate to the next stage at near 10 per cent over the next quarter century and beyond. As documented by the World Bank’s growth commission, since 1950, only thirteen countries have exhibited annual growth rates of 7 per cent or more for a period of twenty-five years or longer. India hasn’t quite joined this exclusive group but it must be our collective endeavour to do so in the coming years. That is the challenge facing the next generation of economic strategy, reform processes and performance.
This is therefore a good time to chronicle the kind of change that the country has experienced over this past quarter century. In some areas the change has been truly transformative, while in others, much more could have been done, particularly in the areas of health, education and agriculture. What reforms were carried out and how do they affect the country? What were our expectations in 1991? What has been achieved, and what not? And, where do we go from here? These are the kind of questions that we set out to address as we started work on this book.
Through my thirty years being in and around the government, I have had the good fortune of being associated in different ways with each of the remarkable individuals who have contributed to this book. I have called upon our bonds of friendship to persuade each of these busy individuals to reflect on their experience as they have transformed themselves, their respective organizations and their country over these twenty-five years. This book brings together thirty technocratic leaders who have participated in this exciting project of nation-building since the early 1990s. This group includes some of the key policymakers and advisers, academics, industry leaders, opinion makers and commentators. Each of them has made key contributions over this period to bring India where it is today. They have worked in their respective fields consistently, and retained their credibility and commitment across a succession of diverse governments of different political persuasions. They have displayed professionalism of the highest order in their respective areas of operations.
My greatest debt of gratitude goes to each of these impressive individuals who, in their folly, agreed to engage and commit their time to contributing to this collection. Given the many different pursuits that they are engaged in, it has been an act of considerable generosity to submit to the tortuous process that goes into the publication of any book. Each of them submitted to the various revisions that I subjected them to, somewhat cheerfully, and then to the professional editing process that followed.
Hence, my heartfelt appreciation for this act of friendship expressed by each of the contributors.
Vikram Mehta, in his role as chairman of Brookings India, must shoulder the blame for setting me on this task. As I returned to India in late 2015, after serving as executive director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), he asked me to babysit Brookings India in early 2016 as he hunted for a full-time successor to Subir Gokarn who had led Brookings India from its inception in 2013, and who had to leave to succeed me at the IMF. As I took up my position in Brookings India, he thought I should also do something more substantive. He came up with the idea that Brookings India should do something to commemorate twenty-five years of reforms. Foolishly, I agreed readily. Then ensued a number of discussions of what this task would entail; and the idea of this collection emerged. My sincere thanks to Vikram for setting me up for doing this and then providing unstinting support, both personally and institutionally. This included active prodding of some recalcitrant authors.
I have received consistent support from Nitika Mehta, the head of development and communications, and Shruti Gakhar, the development and communications officer at Brookings India, throughout the fifteen months or so that this project has taken. Nitika was instrumental in convincing Penguin Random House to publish this volume; how she did so remains a mystery to me since it agreed to do so even before there was any content available. Shruti has been diligently keeping track of each draft article at every stage and has kept all communications with both authors and the editors in good order. Together, they have been the chief interlocutors with the publishers and authors. Along with the publishers, they are also responsible for managing the communications strategy for promotion of the book. My sincere thanks for their consistent and devoted diligence to these tasks which have been far beyond their normal calls of duty at Brookings.
My academic home is now at the Jackson Institute for Global Affairs at Yale University. Most of the work on this volume was done over the 2016–17 academic year at Yale. My sincere thanks go to Jim Levinsohn, the director of the Jackson Institute, for inviting me back to teach at Yale. The quiet, salubrious and supportive environment at the institute was very helpful in getting this task done. As it happens, the finishing touches to my last book were also done at the Jackson Institute in Yale in 2010.
The team at Penguin Random House, led by Meru Gokhale, has been remarkable in the kind of support they have provided which has involved interaction with thirty-two authors. They have been consistently patient and cooperative. Anushree Kaushal has led the editorial team, supported by Rachita Raj and Shanuj V.C.; and Preeti Chaturvedi has led the promotion efforts for the book. My gratitude to all at Penguin who have made this book possible.
I also owe a debt of gratitude to the time and effort that Ritu Vajpeyi-Mohan has devoted to educating me in the art of bookmaking and promotion.
After he took over at Brookings India as executive director, Harsha Vardhana Singh has provided continual encouragement for this enterprise, apart from making his own path-breaking contribution on trade. My sincere thanks.
Finally, I must thank Strobe Talbott for his support as president of Brookings in Washington, and specifically for agreeing to contribute his perspective—from a distance—on India’s transformation.
My family has been almost oblivious to the work that I have been doing on this book! But my intensive engagement in policymaking over the past quarter century and frequent intercontinental movement between India and the United States over the past five years, would not have been possible without their collective forbearance, active support, tolerance and inspiration. My wife, Rasika, has been a tower of strength, especially in the last few years of extreme trial and tribulation, providing me with great cheerfulness, the environment of peace and tranquillity that is essential for undertaking such an endeavour. Tarini, my daughter, inspires us all with her continuing battle against adversity; and Rasesh, my son, gives us consistent support without compromising his own professional goals. His equanimity in the face of many competing professional and personal demands is a lesson on how to keep focus on the essentials.
I dedicate this book to my family: Rasika, Tarini and Rasesh.
 
 
Foreword
Strobe Talbott
This timely, authoritative and policy-relevant volume sheds light on India’s dramatic changes over the past quarter century. That transformation has not only been a boon to the people of India, it has also contributed to the progress of the human enterprise as a whole. The world’s largest democracy is a major player on the world stage. It is certainly viewed and valued that way by my own country, the United States of America.
The economic and commercial dimension of India’s evolution is, of course, crucial. Hence, the focus of submissions in the pages that follow is political economy, financial development, trade and globalization, technology and innovation, agricultural and industrial development, and the interaction between the private and public sectors. The contributors include some of the original designers and implementers of the reform process, along with the prominent business leaders who have been the most successful builders of the economy.
There is also, thanks to the inclusion of wisdom from Shivshankar Menon, Shyam Saran and Sanjaya Baru, due attention paid to India’s foreign and security policy.
Over the course of the last half-century, I have had numerous opportunities to watch India’s evolution, first from the vantage point of a student of international relations and then for two decades as a journalist. During my eight years in government during the 1990s, I also had a chance to participate in the effort by the Indian and the US governments to put the bilateral relationship on a sounder—indeed, a transformed—footing than had been the case in the first four decades after Indian Independence. Dennis Kux captured the perception on both sides of that star-crossed backstory in the subtitle of his 1992 book, India and the United States: Estranged Democracies.1
What stymied a robust bond between these two countries? After all, both had wrested their independence from British rule while adopting and adapting many of the features of British constitutional governance (minus, of course, the monarchy).
The key factor, I’ve always believed, was the Cold War.
It was approximately at the midpoint of that global schism that I first visited India forty-two years ago. I owe that enriching and informative experience to a glitch in my career as a Sovietologist.
In those days, I was a reporter for Time magazine concentrating on East–West relations and was assigned to the State Department beat. This often meant whirling around the world, coping with what seemed like a permanent case of jetlag, trying to keep up with the then secretary of state Henry Kissinger.
In October 1974, Kissinger embarked on a seven-nation diplomatic tour starting with Moscow. The Kremlin was eager to welcome the secretary of state as the personification of continuity in the US policy of détente, in the wake of Richard Nixon’s resignation and Gerald Ford’s ascension to the presidency. The Soviets, however, were not about to extend their hospitality to me. I was persona non grata because of my role in translating and editing Nikita Khrushchev’s memoirs. The material for the two volumes was surreptitiously recorded and spirited out of the country while he was under virtual house arrest, since his ouster from the leadership ten years before. The second volume, published earlier in 1974, particularly irked Foreign Minister Anatoly Gromyko, who sent a message to Kissinger’s plane over the Atlantic, denying me a visa.2
After I was unceremoniously dropped off in Copenhagen during a fuelling stop, I hopscotched to New Delhi, which would be Kissinger’s second stop after Moscow.
On the personal front, my several days of free time were immensely gratifying. I made friendships that lasted for decades. I also came to know Ambassador Daniel Patrick Moynihan (whose desk officer at the State Department was none other than Dennis Kux). Moynihan’s wife, Elizabeth, took me under her wing and drove me out to—where else?—the Taj Mahal, where she was already deeply into studying the Mughal gardens.
In the course of numerous interviews and briefings I had in New Delhi while Kissinger was still in Moscow, I was struck by the deep-rooted and long-simmering tensions in the official relations between the US and Indian governments. These went back to the 1950s, when India’s role as a founder of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) put it at odds with America’s self-assigned leadership of the Free World (a phrase also capitalized in those days). In the aftermath of independence from the Raj, Indian leaders were wary of another Western power claiming a sphere of influence on which the sun would never set. From the official American perspective, India’s purchase of MiGs for its air force and adoption of Soviet-inspired Five-Year Plans led policymakers such as Secretary of State John Foster Dulles to question whose side this giant Asian country was really on.
Even before Henry Kissinger made his first official visit to India, he had already attracted the eye of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. She was still bristling over the Nixon administration’s refusal, three years before, to support India’s intervention in the Bangladesh Liberation War. The columnist Jack Anderson publicized leaked government documents that exposed Kissinger’s critical sentiments about India and, in particular, Mrs Gandhi.3
On the US side, there was concern and disapproval of India’s ‘Smiling Buddha’ underground test of a nuclear device earlier in May 1974 (just a little over three months before the Kissinger mission). American protestations exacerbated Indian resentments.
While Kissinger’s plane was en route from Moscow to New Delhi, Mrs Gandhi gave a press conference denigrating the importance of the impending visit and thereby the visitor himself. To accentuate the snub, she announced that she would be giving the American secretary of state only forty-five minutes of her time before leaving on vacation.
As though that wasn’t bad enough, Kissinger had to spend three days in India. He put on a brave and polite face in public, but he was furious, not least because he had to a give a speech to a New Delhi foreign-policy organization on non-alignment, a subject he hated in general but particularly in the case of India, given its cordial relations with the Soviet Union.
Once, to his undisguised relief, Kissinger was back aboard his Air Force Boeing 707 and was leaving New Delhi behind, he came from his luxurious suite behind the cockpit to the back of the plane. That’s where the press corps (including me, now reinstated) was crammed into economy-class seats, pens poised and notebooks ready for a background readout on the diplomatic downer from ‘a senior American official on Secretary Kissinger’s plane’.
Kissinger had clearly not gotten over his annoyance at Mrs Gandhi. Yet, he also allowed that she was a formidable politician and, like himself, a hard-headed realist.
Leaving personalities aside, he mused about what underlay ‘the chronic disharmony’ between Washington and New Delhi. He saw it as a regional manifestation of a global division between two ideological and geopolitical camps: India’s uneasy, often conflicted, relationship with Pakistan was vexing and dangerous in its own right, but all the more so given the not-inaccurate perception in New Delhi that the US ‘tilted’ towards Pakistan, and the equally defensible sense in Washington that India leaned toward Moscow—to wit, India’s Soviet-designed military aircraft, not to mention its reliance on five-year economic plans of the sort favoured by Fabian socialists.
Kissinger was turning his attention to Pakistan because it would be one of the next stops on the trip. In contrast to Mrs Gandhi, he knew that Zulfikar Ali Bhutto would treat him royally. There would be no talk of non-alignment there.
The secretary concluded his airborne seminar with the reporters by remarking that a genuine partnership between the US and India would be impossible as long as the Cold War lasted. All of us, including him, expected that to be for a very long time, most probably well past our own lifetimes and maybe our children’s. Little did we know that the USSR would last just long enough to reach the biblical lifespan of a single mortal: three score and ten years. The prologue of its demise—though we didn’t realize it as such—came in the form of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979. The administration of Jimmy Carter saw a chance to bog the Soviets down by fighting a proxy war by arming the Afghan mujahideen.
During that period, I made a number of trips to Kabul, primarily to interview a series of Moscow-manipulated presidents, all of whom came to violent ends. Each of these trips took me through New Delhi, partly for the connection to Ariana Airlines but also to pick the brains of Indian specialists and government officials. While helpful, these conversations invariably contained two messages: expressions of deep misgivings about yet another instance in which the US was reliant on its Pakistani allies, and stark warnings that the mujahideen would eventually radicalize Afghanistan itself, make common cause with likeminded elements in Pakistan, and turn their jihadist furore on India and, very possibly, on the West.
So, there it was again—a reminder of how the Cold War had kept morphing in ways that hindered mutual trust, not to mention strategic cooperation, between the US and India.
Suddenly, in the late 1980s, what John F. Kennedy called the US’s ‘long twilight struggle’ with the Soviet Union ended, first with the reforms of Mikhail Gorbachev, then with collapse of the Berlin Wall, the Iron Curtain, the Warsaw Pact, and, on Christmas Day 1991, the USSR itself.
Thirteen months later, Bill Clinton was inaugurated as the forty-second President of the United States. He came into office determined to take full advantage of how the world had changed, including by not just improving but transforming US–India relations. He understood that there were twin reasons why these two democracies should pass from estrangement to engagement: one was the end of the Cold War, and the other was India’s reaching out to the world economically and commercially. As deputy secretary of state, first under Warren Christopher, then under Madeleine Albright, I participated in the diplomacy necessary to take advantage of the opportunities that came with these propitious trends.
My first visit to New Delhi in that capacity came in 1994. I met with Prime Minister Narasimha Rao and his finance minister, Manmohan Singh, who initiated many of the economic reforms that Rakesh Mohan and his fellow contributors analyse in this book.
The following year, the First Lady, Hillary Clinton, took a long tour of South Asia, concentrating on India. On her return, she told me that she was more convinced than ever that the administration should make ‘a new opening’ to India a hallmark of its foreign policy.
My most intense experience with India came in the final three years of the Clinton administration. The precipitating event was the May 1998 nuclear tests at Pokhran in the Rajasthan desert, which led to a strategic dialogue consisting of fourteen meetings with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s designated representative, the then minister of external affairs Jaswant Singh. The immediate task was to see if we could narrow the gap between our countries’ security interests and non-proliferation policies, an effort that eventually led to the US–India civil nuclear agreement consummated by the George W. Bush administration and the government of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in 2005.
But the diplomatic engagement produced another, earlier and, I believe, no less significant achievement: the Indian government’s willingness to permit an American President to involve himself in a conflict between itself and Pakistan. A Pakistani incursion across the Line of Control in the Himalayas in the early spring of 1999 escalated to a full-blown crisis with the potential of going nuclear. Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif made a desperate flight to Washington, hoping for a mediated resolution favourable to Pakistan or at least a face-saving compromise. Intense negotiations were under way in Blair House, across the street from the White House, over the course of the Fourth of July weekend. Meanwhile, in India, Prime Minister Vajpayee feared yet another tilt towards Pakistan. Instead, Bill Clinton succeeded in convincing Nawaz Sharif that there was no alternative to full withdrawal of Pakistani forces back across the Line of Control.
Once the danger was defused, Jaswant called me from New Delhi. ‘Something terrible has happened these past several months between us and our neighbours,’ he said. ‘But something quite new and good has happened this weekend between our own countries, yours and mine—something related to the matter of trust. My prime minister and I thank your President for that.’
When Clinton visited India the following March, he made clear to the government, Parliament and the people of India that, in his mind at least, the prospects for the relationship were now in line with the two nations’ interests and values.4
After my stint in government, I spent an academic year at Yale University, where Nayan Chanda—a friend and fellow journalist whom I had known for decades—and I established the Yale Center for the Study of Globalization. Nayan also founded Yale Global, a web-based journal, that he still edits from New Delhi, an arrangement that is in itself an example of globalization.
When I came to Brookings in the summer of 2002, I was pleased to discover that my predecessors had long given significant attention to India. In the late 1950s, John P. Lewis, an economist whose career alternated between academe and government, spent considerable time in India and became a far-flung affiliate of Brookings. He had a pied-à-terre in Friends Colony in New Delhi and travelled widely around the country, sending reports back to Brookings for scholars there to use in their own research and public events. The Planning Commission requested that he prepare memoranda for its consideration while it was preparing the Third Five-Year Plan.
Lewis’s Brookings reports were praised by John Kenneth Galbraith when he arrived in New Delhi as President John F. Kennedy’s ambassador. President Lyndon Johnson later put Lewis in charge of the United States Agency for International Development in India (USAID).
In the 1960s and 1970s, the Brookings Institution Press published several books on Indian social and economic policy.5 In addition to that encouraging legacy, Brookings has had, since 1988, in Stephen P. Cohen, a world-class expert on South Asia. He, like many Brookings scholars, combined academic distinction and government experience (he served on the State Department’s policy planning office in the Reagan administration).
Another Brookings scholar, Barry Bosworth, had developed expertise on Asian economies. Two South Asia hands from the Foreign Service Office, whom I had gotten to know in the 1990s, Teresita and Howard Schaffer, have also been affiliated with Brookings.6
Soon after I had found my sea legs at Brookings, I asked the help of these colleagues in upgrading our work on—and in—India, with the ultimate goal of setting up a Brookings presence there.
As a first step, we joined with the National Council on Applied Economic Research, then headed by Suman Bery. He, Barry Bosworth and Arvind Panagariya (then affiliated with Brookings as well as Columbia University) founded an annual publication, The India Policy Forum, modelled on The Brookings Papers on Economic Activities, which, for more than forty-five years, has been the premier forum drawing together top economists to write papers and discuss pressing macroeconomic policies.
I travelled to New Delhi in 2004 for the rollout of the first issue, a well-attended and widely covered event at which Montek Singh Ahluwalia, then deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, delivered an address. The India Policy Forum is now in its thirteenth year.
It took more than a decade for Martin Indyk, now the executive vice president of Brookings, and Tanvi Madan, the director of our India Project, to achieve our ultimate goal, Brookings India. The realization of this dream was made possible by the generosity, advice and—that word again—engagement of our Founders’ Circle. Also crucial was Vikram Singh Mehta’s willingness to become the chairman of the enterprise and Subir Gokarn providing his own leadership as research director.
Brookings India cleared all regulatory hurdles and was registered as an Indian non-profit entity in June 2014. Vikram and Subir steered it through this initial phase and then, when Subir moved to Washington DC as India’s executive director on the board of the IMF, Rakesh Mohan, his predecessor there, returned to India and provided the much-needed leadership support in the interim, before departing to teach at Yale. This volume is the result of his endeavours at Brookings. We are now fortunate to have as executive director of Brookings India a leading trade economist, Harsha Vardhana Singh, who, as deputy director general was, for eight years, deputy to Pascal Lamy at the World Trade Organization (WTO).
The establishment of Brookings India has been made possible by the generous and visionary support of the Brookings India Initiative Founders’ Circle, a group of over thirty donors that believes in the importance of independent policy research at this critical juncture in India’s history. Brookings India started operations in 2013 with support from its Founders’ Circle, each donating equal amounts. This was important to ensure a working environment that no individual or corporation had influence over. The Founders’ Circle has emphasized and encouraged independent research, along the lines of the emphasis by Brookings India scholars on determining their own independent and objective research agenda.
We look forward to Brookings becoming a mainstream think tank, contributing constructively to the argumentative intellectual and policymaking firmament in India.
This book has brought together many of the intellectuals, policymakers and business leaders who have contributed to the incredible transformation that has taken place in India over the past quarter century. We hope that it will serve to inspire the next generation leaders who shape India’s destiny in the coming years.
Rakesh developed the idea of this book, prodded skilfully by Vikram Mehta. He conceived of its content, approached the authors, reviewed and edited the contributions and finalized the manuscript with the publishers. This book is the result of his singular contribution, for which Brookings India owes him a debt of gratitude.
